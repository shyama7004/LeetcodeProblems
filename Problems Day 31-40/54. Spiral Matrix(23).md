## Description
Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

## Example 1:
**Input:** 
```markdown
matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
```

**Output:** 
```markdown
[1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
```

## Example 2:
**Input:** 
```markdown
matrix = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12]]
```

**Output:** 
```markdown
[1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]
```

## Constraints:
- m == matrix.length
- n == matrix[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 10
- -100 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100

### Approach and Intuition

The problem requires traversing a 2D matrix in a spiral order, meaning we need to visit the matrix elements in a specific sequence: from the top row left to right, then the right column top to bottom, followed by the bottom row right to left, and finally the left column bottom to top. This pattern is repeated by progressively narrowing the bounds of the matrix until all elements are visited.

### Improved Logic
1. **Initialize boundaries**: Set the initial boundaries for rows and columns.
2. **Iterate while there are elements to traverse**: Loop until the total count of traversed elements equals the number of elements in the matrix.
3. **Traverse the top row**: From the left boundary to the right boundary, then move the top boundary downwards.
4. **Traverse the right column**: From the top boundary to the bottom boundary, then move the right boundary to the left.
5. **Traverse the bottom row**: From the right boundary to the left boundary, then move the bottom boundary upwards.
6. **Traverse the left column**: From the bottom boundary to the top boundary, then move the left boundary to the right.
7. **Repeat until all elements are traversed**.

### Code
Here is the improved version of the provided code with added comments and optimized structure:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> spiralOrder(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        vector<int> ans;
        int row = matrix.size();
        int col = matrix[0].size();

        // Initial boundaries
        int startingRow = 0;
        int startingCol = 0;
        int endingRow = row - 1;
        int endingCol = col - 1;

        // Iterate while there are elements to traverse
        while (startingRow <= endingRow && startingCol <= endingCol) {
            // Traverse the top row from left to right
            for (int index = startingCol; index <= endingCol; index++) {
                ans.push_back(matrix[startingRow][index]);
            }
            startingRow++;

            // Traverse the right column from top to bottom
            for (int index = startingRow; index <= endingRow; index++) {
                ans.push_back(matrix[index][endingCol]);
            }
            endingCol--;

            // Traverse the bottom row from right to left if there are remaining rows
            if (startingRow <= endingRow) {
                for (int index = endingCol; index >= startingCol; index--) {
                    ans.push_back(matrix[endingRow][index]);
                }
                endingRow--;
            }

            // Traverse the left column from bottom to top if there are remaining columns
            if (startingCol <= endingCol) {
                for (int index = endingRow; index >= startingRow; index--) {
                    ans.push_back(matrix[index][startingCol]);
                }
                startingCol++;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

### Detailed Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `vector<int> ans;` initializes the vector to store the result.
   - `int row = matrix.size();` and `int col = matrix[0].size();` store the dimensions of the matrix.
   - `startingRow`, `startingCol`, `endingRow`, and `endingCol` are initialized to represent the current bounds of the traversal.

2. **Traversal Loop**: 
   - The `while` loop continues as long as there are unvisited rows and columns (`startingRow <= endingRow && startingCol <= endingCol`).

3. **Top Row Traversal**:
   - The `for` loop iterates over the columns from the left boundary (`startingCol`) to the right boundary (`endingCol`), adding elements from the current top row (`startingRow`) to the result.
   - After traversing the top row, the top boundary is moved down (`startingRow++`).

4. **Right Column Traversal**:
   - The next `for` loop iterates from the current top boundary (`startingRow`) to the bottom boundary (`endingRow`), adding elements from the current right column (`endingCol`) to the result.
   - After traversing the right column, the right boundary is moved left (`endingCol--`).

5. **Bottom Row Traversal**:
   - The `if` check ensures there are remaining rows to process. The `for` loop iterates from the right boundary (`endingCol`) to the left boundary (`startingCol`), adding elements from the current bottom row (`endingRow`) to the result.
   - After traversing the bottom row, the bottom boundary is moved up (`endingRow--`).

6. **Left Column Traversal**:
   - The final `if` check ensures there are remaining columns to process. The `for` loop iterates from the bottom boundary (`endingRow`) to the top boundary (`startingRow`), adding elements from the current left column (`startingCol`) to the result.
   - After traversing the left column, the left boundary is moved right (`startingCol++`).
### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the provided solution is O(m times n), where (m) is the number of rows and (n) is the number of columns in the matrix.

- **Reasoning**: Each element in the matrix is visited exactly once in a single traversal. The traversal involves going through each row and column in a spiral order, which means all (m times n) elements are processed. Therefore, the time complexity is O(m times n).

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of the provided solution is O(1) for the extra space used, excluding the space required to store the output.

- **Reasoning**: The algorithm uses a few integer variables (e.g., `startingRow`, `startingCol`, `endingRow`, `endingCol`, `count`, `elements`) and a result vector `ans` to store the output. The space required for the result vector `ans` is O(m times n), which is necessary to store the elements of the matrix in spiral order.
- Since the space used by the extra variables is constant and does not grow with the size of the input matrix, it is O(1).
- The total space complexity, considering the space needed for the output, is O(m times n).

### Summary
- **Time Complexity**: O(m times n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(m times n) (due to the output vector, with extra space being O(1)

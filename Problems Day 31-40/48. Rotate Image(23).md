# 48. Rotate Image

## Problem Statement

You are given an `n x n` 2D matrix representing an image. Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image **in-place**, which means you must modify the input 2D matrix directly. **DO NOT** allocate another 2D matrix for the rotation.

## Example 1:

**Input:** 
```
matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
```

**Output:**
```
[[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]
```

---

## Example 2:

**Input:** 
```
matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]
```

**Output:**
```
[[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]
```

---

## Constraints:

- `n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 20`
- `-1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000`

### Rotating a Matrix by 90 Degrees Clockwise

#### Initial Code

The initial code snippet intended to rotate a matrix by 90 degrees clockwise contains several issues:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void rotate(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        int row = matrix.size();
        int col = matrix[0].size();
        int startingRow = 0;
        int staringCol = 0;
        int endingRow = row - 1;
        int endingCol = col - 1;

        while(startingRow <= endingRow && staringCol <= endingCol)
        {
            for(int i = startingRow; i <= endingRow; i++)
            {
                matrix.push_back(matrix[i][endingCol])
            }
            endingCol--;
        }
    }
};
```

#### Issues in the Initial Code
1. **Typo in Variable Name:** The variable `staringCol` should be `startingCol`.
2. **Missing Semicolon:** There is a missing semicolon at the end of the `matrix.push_back(matrix[i][endingCol])` statement.
3. **Incorrect Logic for Rotation:** The approach used in the code does not correctly rotate the matrix. It attempts to push elements to the matrix, which is not the correct method for rotation.

#### Correct Approach and Logic

To rotate a matrix by 90 degrees clockwise, the process can be broken down into two main steps:
1. **Transpose the Matrix:**
   - Convert rows to columns. For example, element `matrix[i][j]` is swapped with `matrix[j][i]`.
2. **Reverse Each Row:**
   - After transposing, reverse the elements in each row.

### Explanation of Correct Approach

1. **Transpose the Matrix:**
   - Iterate through the matrix and swap elements across the diagonal. This means for every `i` and `j`, swap `matrix[i][j]` with `matrix[j][i]`.

2. **Reverse Each Row:**
   - After transposing, each row in the matrix is reversed to get the desired 90-degree clockwise rotation.

### Correct Code

Here's the corrected and complete implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    void rotate(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        int n = matrix.size();
        
        // Transpose the matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = i; j < n; ++j) {
                swap(matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i]);
            }
        }
        
        // Reverse each row
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            reverse(matrix[i].begin(), matrix[i].end());
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of Correct Code

1. **Transpose the Matrix:**
   - The outer loop runs through each row, and the inner loop runs from the current row to the end of the row. This ensures that each element above the diagonal is swapped with the corresponding element below the diagonal.
   - For example, `matrix[i][j]` is swapped with `matrix[j][i]`.

2. **Reverse Each Row:**
   - After transposing, the rows are reversed using the `reverse()` function from the C++ Standard Library, which reverses the elements in place.

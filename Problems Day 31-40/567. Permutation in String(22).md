# 567. Permutation in String

## Problem Statement

Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, return `true` if `s2` contains a permutation of `s1`, or `false` otherwise.

In other words, return `true` if one of `s1`'s permutations is a substring of `s2`.

## Example 1:

**Input**:  
```
s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidbaooo"
```

**Output**:  
```
true
```

**Explanation**:  
`s2` contains one permutation of `s1` ("ba").

## Example 2:

**Input**:  
```
s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidboaoo"
```

**Output**:  
```
false
```

## Constraints:

- 1 ≤ `s1.length`, `s2.length` ≤ 10⁴
- `s1` and `s2` consist of lowercase English letters.
## Approach

- first store character count similar to that arr[26] = {0}; question.
- make a window and traverse through the array checking wether a permutation exsists or not.
- we have stored a count as we want to compare it later with window array.
- after the first comparison for example eidbaooo with ab in fisrt window we compare 'ab' with ei which is false now what we do is increase the count of the number you have and secrease the count of the the character you left:)

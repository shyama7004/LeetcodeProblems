# 443. String Compression(Imp)

## Problem Statement
Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it using the following algorithm:

- Begin with an empty string `s`.
- For each group of consecutive repeating characters in `chars`:
  - If the group's length is 1, append the character to `s`.
  - Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

The compressed string `s` should not be returned separately, but instead be stored in the input character array `chars`. Note that group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`.

After you are done modifying the input array, return the new length of the array.

You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:** 
```python
chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
```

**Output:** 
Return `6`, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: 
```python
["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
```

**Explanation:**  
The groups are `"aa"`, `"bb"`, and `"ccc"`. This compresses to `"a2b2c3"`.

---

### Example 2:
**Input:** 
```python
chars = ["a"]
```

**Output:**  
Return `1`, and the first character of the input array should be: 
```python
["a"]
```

**Explanation:**  
The only group is `"a"`, which remains uncompressed since it's a single character.

---

### Example 3:
**Input:** 
```python
chars = ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
```

**Output:**  
Return `4`, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: 
```python
["a","b","1","2"]
```

**Explanation:**  
The groups are `"a"` and `"bbbbbbbbbbbb"`. This compresses to `"ab12"`.

---

## Constraints:
- `1 <= chars.length <= 2000`
- `chars[i]` is a lowercase English letter, uppercase English letter, digit, or symbol.


## Logic

1.	If a character appears only once, store the character as is.
2.	If a character appears more than once, store the character followed by the number of times it was repeated.
 

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int compress(vector<char>& chars) {
        int ansIndex = 0; // To store the characters and the number of times they have repeated
        int i = 0;
        int n = chars.size();
        
        while (i < n) {
            int j = i + 1;
            // Check if the consecutive elements are equal or not
            while (j < n && chars[j] == chars[i]) {
                j++;
            }
            // We have seen all the same characters, now we proceed to the next character

            chars[ansIndex++] = chars[i]; // Storing the character
            int count = j - i; // To get the number of same characters
            if (count > 1) {
                string cnt = to_string(count); // Convert the number to a string
                for (char ch : cnt) { // Traverse through all the characters of the string representation of count
                    chars[ansIndex++] = ch; // Put the number of repetitions in the array
                }
            }
            i = j; // Move to the next new character
        }
        return ansIndex; // Return the new length of the compressed array
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `ansIndex`: This index is used to keep track of the position in the `chars` array where the next unique character or count will be stored.
   - `i`: This is the current index being checked.
   - `n`: This is the size of the `chars` array.

2. **While Loop:**
   - The outer `while` loop runs until `i` is less than `n`.
   - `j` starts from `i + 1` and increments as long as the characters at `chars[j]` and `chars[i]` are equal. This inner `while` loop helps in counting the occurrences of the same character.

3. **Storing the Character:**
   - After counting the occurrences, the character `chars[i]` is stored at the current `ansIndex`, and `ansIndex` is incremented.

4. **Storing the Count:**
   - `count` is calculated as `j - i`, which gives the number of occurrences of the character `chars[i]`.
   - If `count` is greater than 1, convert `count` to a string.
   - Traverse through the string representation of `count` and store each character in the `chars` array at `ansIndex`, incrementing `ansIndex` after each insertion.

5. **Moving to the Next Character:**
   - Set `i` to `j` to start checking from the next new character.

6. **Return:**
   - Finally, return `ansIndex`, which is the length of the compressed array.

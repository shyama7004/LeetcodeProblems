# 74. Search a 2D Matrix


## Problem

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix` with the following two properties:

1. Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
2. The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Given an integer `target`, return `true` if `target` is in the matrix or `false` otherwise.

You must write a solution in **O(log(m * n))** time complexity.

## Example 1

**Input:** 
``` 
matrix = [[1,3,5,7],
          [10,11,16,20],
          [23,30,34,60]], 
target = 3
```

**Output:** 
```
true
```

## Example 2

**Input:** 
``` 
matrix = [[1,3,5,7],
          [10,11,16,20],
          [23,30,34,60]], 
target = 13
```

**Output:** 
```
false
```

## Constraints

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `-10^4 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 10^4`

## Visualization of the Logic

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Treat the 2D Matrix as a Linear Array:**
   - Although the matrix is 2D (with rows and columns), we can think of it as a flattened 1D array, where each element of the matrix can be accessed using a single index.
   - The key idea is to map any index `i` in this flattened array back to the corresponding element in the original 2D matrix.
   
2. **Perform Binary Search on the Flattened Array:**
   - We apply **binary search** on this linearized version of the matrix. Binary search is efficient, with a time complexity of **O(log(m * n))**, which meets the problem's requirements.

3. **Set the Search Boundaries:**
   - Define `start = 0` and `end = m * n - 1`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. These represent the first and last elements of the matrix when considered as a 1D array.

4. **Calculate the Mid-Index:**
   - The mid-point in a binary search is typically calculated as:
     ```
     mid = (start + end) // 2
     ```
   - However, since we are treating the matrix as 1D, we need to convert this 1D index (`mid`) back to its corresponding position in the 2D matrix. We can do this by calculating the row and column from `mid`:
     ```
     row = mid // n
     column = mid % n
     ```
   - Here, `n` is the number of columns in the matrix.

5. **Compare the Target with the Middle Element:**
   - Once we have the element at `matrix[row][column]` (from the mid index), there are three possible cases:
     - If `matrix[row][column] == target`: Return `true`.
     - If `matrix[row][column] < target`: Narrow the search to the right half by setting `start = mid + 1`.
     - If `matrix[row][column] > target`: Narrow the search to the left half by setting `end = mid - 1`.

6. **Continue the Search Until the Target is Found or Search Space is Exhausted:**
   - Repeat the process until `start > end`. If the loop exits and the target is not found, return `false`.

### Example Walkthrough:

For the matrix:
```
matrix = [[1, 3, 5, 7],
          [10, 11, 16, 20],
          [23, 30, 34, 60]]
target = 16
```

- The matrix has 3 rows and 4 columns, so we treat it as a 1D array with 12 elements:
  ```
  [1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 11, 16, 20, 23, 30, 34, 60]
  ```
- Set `start = 0` and `end = 11`.
- First, calculate `mid = (0 + 11) // 2 = 5`. The element at index 5 in this "1D array" is `matrix[1][1] = 11`.
  - Since `11 < 16`, adjust `start = mid + 1 = 6`.
- Next, calculate `mid = (6 + 11) // 2 = 8`. The element at index 8 is `matrix[2][0] = 23`.
  - Since `23 > 16`, adjust `end = mid - 1 = 7`.
- Now, calculate `mid = (6 + 7) // 2 = 6`. The element at index 6 is `matrix[1][2] = 16`.
  - Since `16 == 16`, we return `true`.

This approach ensures efficient searching in **O(log(m * n))** time.

## Code

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    bool searchMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int target) {
        int rows = matrix.size();
        int cols = matrix[0].size();
        
        int start = 0;
        int end = (rows * cols) - 1;

        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            int element = matrix[mid / cols][mid % cols];  // Convert 1D index to 2D matrix index

            if (element == target) {
                return true;
            }
            else if (element > target) {
                end = mid - 1;
            } 
            else {
                start = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return false;  // If target is not found
    }
};
```
### Time Complexity:
- The algorithm performs a binary search over a virtual 1D array of size `m * n`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
- Binary search has a time complexity of **O(log(m * n))**, as it repeatedly halves the search space.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is **O(1)** since no additional data structures are used, and the algorithm only uses a few variables (`start`, `end`, `mid`, `element`) for computation. All operations are done in place.

# 1910. Remove All Occurrences of a Substring

## Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `part`, perform the following operation on `s` until all occurrences of the substring `part` are removed:

- Find the leftmost occurrence of the substring `part` and remove it from `s`.
- Return `s` after removing all occurrences of `part`.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

## Example 1:

**Input**:  
```
s = "daabcbaabcbc", part = "abc"
```

**Output**:  
```
"dab"
```

**Explanation**:  
The following operations are done:
- `s = "daabcbaabcbc"`, remove `"abc"` starting at index 2, so `s = "dabaabcbc"`.
- `s = "dabaabcbc"`, remove `"abc"` starting at index 4, so `s = "dababc"`.
- `s = "dababc"`, remove `"abc"` starting at index 3, so `s = "dab"`.

Now `s` has no occurrences of `"abc"`.

## Example 2:

**Input**:  
```
s = "axxxxyyyyb", part = "xy"
```

**Output**:  
```
"ab"
```

**Explanation**:  
The following operations are done:
- `s = "axxxxyyyyb"`, remove `"xy"` starting at index 4, so `s = "axxxyyyb"`.
- `s = "axxxyyyb"`, remove `"xy"` starting at index 3, so `s = "axxyyb"`.
- `s = "axxyyb"`, remove `"xy"` starting at index 2, so `s = "axyb"`.
- `s = "axyb"`, remove `"xy"` starting at index 1, so `s = "ab"`.

Now `s` has no occurrences of `"xy"`.

## Constraints:
- 1 ≤ `s.length` ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ `part.length` ≤ 1000
- `s` and `part` consist of lowercase English letters.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string removeOccurrences(string s, string part) {
       while(s.length() != 0 && s.find(part) < s.length())
       {
            s.erase(s.find(part), part.length());
       } 
       return s;
    }
};
```

### Intuition:
The code removes all occurrences of a substring (`part`) from the given string (`s`).

### Logic:
1. **Loop**: Repeatedly checks if `part` exists in `s`.
2. **Find**: `s.find(part)` returns the starting index of the first occurrence of `part` in `s`.
3. **Erase**: If `part` is found, it erases that portion from `s`.
4. **Repeat**: Continues until `part` no longer exists in `s`.

### Approach:
- Keep finding and erasing the substring `part` in a loop until it no longer appears in the string.
- Return the modified string once all occurrences of `part` are removed.

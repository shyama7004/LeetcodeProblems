# 509. Fibonacci Number

## Problem Statement

The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted `F(n)`, form a sequence called the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. Specifically:

- `F(0) = 0`
- `F(1) = 1`
- `F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)`, for `n > 1`.

Given `n`, calculate `F(n)`.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `n = 2`  
**Output:** `1`  
**Explanation:** `F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1`.

### Example 2

**Input:** `n = 3`  
**Output:** `2`  
**Explanation:** `F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2`.

### Example 3

**Input:** `n = 4`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:** `F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3`.

## Constraints

- `0 <= n <= 30`

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int fib(int n) {
        if(n == 0) return 0;
        if(n == 1) return 1;

        int a = 0,b = 1;
        for(int i = 2;i<=n;++i)
        {
            int next = a+b;
            a = b;
            b = next;
        }
    return b;
    }

};
```
## Explanation
```cpp
        if(n == 0) return 0;
        if(n == 1) return 1;
```
- **Explanation**: These are base cases for the Fibonacci sequence. 
  - If `n` is `0`, the function returns `0` immediately.
  - If `n` is `1`, the function returns `1` immediately.
  
  These conditions handle the smallest cases in the Fibonacci sequence.

```cpp
        int a = 0, b = 1;
```
- **Explanation**: Two integers, `a` and `b`, are initialized. `a` represents `fib(0)` (i.e., 0), and `b` represents `fib(1)` (i.e., 1). These variables will be used to store the last two Fibonacci numbers in the sequence as we compute the next one.

```cpp
        for(int i = 2; i <= n; ++i)
        {
```
- **Explanation**: A `for` loop starts from `i = 2` and runs until `i` is equal to `n`. This loop will be used to calculate the Fibonacci numbers iteratively from `fib(2)` up to `fib(n)`.

```cpp
            int next = a + b;
```
- **Explanation**: Inside the loop, `next` is calculated as the sum of `a` and `b`, which represent the last two Fibonacci numbers. This gives the next Fibonacci number in the sequence.

```cpp
            a = b;
            b = next;
```
- **Explanation**: After computing the next Fibonacci number, the values of `a` and `b` are updated. 
  - `a` takes the value of `b` (the current Fibonacci number), 
  - `b` takes the value of `next` (the newly calculated Fibonacci number).

  This step effectively shifts the window of the last two Fibonacci numbers forward.

```cpp
        }
```
- **Explanation**: The loop ends here. After the loop finishes, `b` will hold the value of `fib(n)`.

```cpp
    return b;
```
- **Explanation**: The function returns `b`, which now contains the Fibonacci number at position `n`.

```cpp
    }
};
```
- **Explanation**: The class and function definitions end here.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this function is **O(n)** because the loop runs `n-1` times, which simplifies to `O(n)`.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity of this function is **O(1)**. The function uses a constant amount of space regardless of the input size, as it only uses a few integer variables (`a`, `b`, `next`).

### Summary

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n, unordered_map<int, int>& memo) {
        if (n == 0 || n == 1) return 1;
        if (memo.find(n) == memo.end()) {
            memo[n] = climbStairs(n-1, memo) + climbStairs(n-2, memo);
        }
        return memo[n];
    }
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        unordered_map<int, int> memo;
        return climbStairs(n, memo);
    }
};
```

In the given code, the line:

```cpp
if (memo.find(n) == memo.end()) {
    memo[n] = climbStairs(n-1, memo) + climbStairs(n-2, memo);
}
```

is crucial for implementing memoization in the recursive solution for the "Climbing Stairs" problem. Let's break down what this line does:

### Explanation:

1. **`memo.find(n) == memo.end()`**:
   - The `memo` is an unordered map (hashmap) used to store previously computed results for each value of `n`. 
   - The function `memo.find(n)` searches the map for the key `n`. If the key is found, it returns an iterator to the element; if it’s not found, it returns `memo.end()`, which represents the end of the map.
   - So, `memo.find(n) == memo.end()` checks whether `n` is **not** already stored in the map. This condition is true if the value of `n` has **not** been calculated yet.

2. **`memo[n] = climbStairs(n-1, memo) + climbStairs(n-2, memo);`**:
   - If `n` is not found in `memo`, the code computes the result recursively as the sum of the results for `climbStairs(n-1, memo)` and `climbStairs(n-2, memo)`. This is based on the observation that to reach the nth step, you can either come from the (n-1)th step or the (n-2)th step.
   - Once the result is computed, it is stored in `memo[n]`. This ensures that the next time `climbStairs(n, memo)` is called with the same `n`, the result can be retrieved directly from `memo` without recalculating it. This optimization significantly reduces the time complexity of the solution.

### Purpose of This Line:
This line implements the **memoization** technique. Memoization is a way to store intermediate results of expensive function calls so that they can be reused later. In this problem, it helps avoid redundant calculations, leading to a more efficient solution. Without memoization, the recursive approach would have a time complexity of \(O(2^n)\), but with memoization, it improves to \(O(n)\).

### instead of this unordered_map<int, int>& memo, can i write this unordered_map<int, int> memo ?

You can technically write `unordered_map<int, int> memo` instead of `unordered_map<int, int>& memo`, but it will have significant consequences on the performance and behavior of your code.

### Key Differences:

1. **Passing by Reference (`unordered_map<int, int>& memo`)**:
    - When you pass the `memo` by reference, any updates made to it within the recursive function are reflected across all recursive calls. This allows memoization to work correctly because previously computed results are stored and reused in subsequent calls.
    - The reference ensures that there is a single `memo` object shared across all recursive calls, preventing redundant calculations.

2. **Passing by Value (`unordered_map<int, int> memo`)**:
    - If you pass `memo` by value, each recursive call creates a new copy of the map. This means any updates made to `memo` in one call are lost when moving to a different recursive branch.
    - As a result, each recursive call starts with its own fresh (empty) map, defeating the purpose of memoization. This will lead to the same exponential time complexity as a naive recursive approach because results are not being reused.

### Example Scenario:
If you pass `memo` by value, consider the following call:

```cpp
climbStairs(5);
```

Here’s what happens:
- The first call (`climbStairs(5)`) creates a new `memo` map.
- The next call (`climbStairs(4)`) creates another new `memo` map, independent of the previous one.
- This continues for every recursive call, and no previously computed values are stored or reused, making memoization ineffective.

### Conclusion:
You **should** pass `memo` by reference (`unordered_map<int, int>& memo`). This ensures that all recursive calls share the same map, enabling efficient memoization. Passing by value will result in poor performance because the benefit of memoization is lost.

# Problem 188: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV

- Companies : Amazon, Apple, Nvidia, Google, Citadel

## Problem Summary

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` represents the price of a given stock on day `i`. You also have an integer `k`, which is the maximum number of transactions you can make (a transaction is one "buy" followed by one "sell"). Your goal is to maximize the profit you can achieve with at most `k` transactions.

### Key Points:

- You cannot engage in multiple transactions at the same time (you must sell the stock before you can buy again).
- You want to maximize your profit by making up to `k` transactions.

### Example Scenarios

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** `k = 2`, `prices = [2, 4, 1]`
- **Output:** `2`
- **Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4). The profit is 4 - 2 = 2.

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** `k = 2`, `prices = [3, 2, 6, 5, 0, 3]`
- **Output:** `7`
- **Explanation:** 
  - Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6). Profit = 6 - 2 = 4.
  - Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3). Profit = 3 - 0 = 3.
  - Total profit = 4 + 3 = 7.

## Understanding Dynamic Programming (DP)

### What is Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. This approach is particularly useful for optimization problems where you want to maximize or minimize a certain value.

### Key Concepts in Dynamic Programming:

1. **Overlapping Subproblems:**  
   DP is used when a problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that overlap, meaning the same subproblems are solved multiple times. By storing the results of these subproblems, DP avoids redundant computations.

2. **Optimal Substructure:**  
   A problem exhibits optimal substructure if the optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from the optimal solutions to its subproblems.

3. **DP Table:**  
   DP problems are typically solved using a table (array or matrix) where each entry represents the solution to a subproblem. This table is filled in a systematic way to build up the solution to the original problem.

4. **Recurrence Relation:**  
   The relationship that defines the value of the DP table entry in terms of the values of its neighboring entries. This relation helps to fill in the DP table iteratively.

### DP in Stock Problems

Stock problems often involve decisions about when to buy and sell stocks to maximize profit. These decisions can be modeled using DP by considering various states like holding a stock or not holding a stock on a particular day.

In Problem 188, DP helps in tracking the maximum profit achievable with up to `k` transactions, using a 2D DP table.

## Approach Using Dynamic Programming

1. **If `k` is Large (i.e., Unlimited Transactions):**  
   If `k` is larger than half the number of days (`k >= prices.size() / 2`), the problem simplifies to allowing as many transactions as you want. In this case, you can just add up all the profitable price differences.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table (DP Table):**  
   We maintain a 2D table `dp[i][j]`, where:
   - `i` is the number of transactions (up to `k`).
   - `j` is the day index.

   The goal is to fill this table such that `dp[i][j]` holds the maximum profit achievable using `i` transactions by day `j`.

3. **Recurrence Relation:**  
   The relation used to update the DP table is:
   ```cpp
   dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j-1], prices[j] + max_diff);
   ```
   Here, `max_diff` is a helper variable that keeps track of the best possible profit from previous days:
   ```cpp
   max_diff = max(max_diff, dp[i-1][j] - prices[j]);
   ```

   This relation helps decide whether to:
   - Skip the transaction on day `j` (`dp[i][j-1]`), or
   - Make a transaction by buying earlier and selling on day `j`.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(int k, vector<int>& prices) {
        int n = prices.size();
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        
        // If k is large enough, treat it as an unlimited transaction problem
        if (k >= n / 2) {
            int maxProfit = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
                if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
                    maxProfit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
                }
            }
            return maxProfit;
        }
        
        // DP array to store maximum profit
        vector<vector<int>> dp(k + 1, vector<int>(n, 0));
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) {
            int maxDiff = -prices[0];
            for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j - 1], prices[j] + maxDiff);
                maxDiff = max(maxDiff, dp[i - 1][j] - prices[j]);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[k][n - 1];
    }
};
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(int k, vector<int>& prices) {
```
- **Class and Function Declaration**: The class `Solution` contains a public method `maxProfit` which takes an integer `k` (the maximum number of transactions allowed) and a vector `prices` (the stock prices for each day). The method returns the maximum profit that can be achieved.

```cpp
        int n = prices.size();
```
- **Get the Number of Days**: The variable `n` stores the size of the `prices` vector, which represents the number of days for which stock prices are given.

```cpp
        if (n == 0) return 0;
```
- **Edge Case Check**: If there are no prices (`n` is 0), thereâ€™s no possibility of making a profit, so the function returns 0 immediately.

```cpp
        if (k >= n / 2) {
```
- **Unlimited Transactions Case**: If the number of allowed transactions `k` is greater than or equal to half the number of days, it means you can make as many transactions as needed, so we treat it as an unlimited transactions problem.

```cpp
            int maxProfit = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
```
- **Initialize Max Profit**: A variable `maxProfit` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the total profit.
- **Iterate Over Days**: The loop starts from the second day (`i = 1`) and goes through each day to calculate the profit.

```cpp
                if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
                    maxProfit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
                }
```
- **Profit Calculation for Unlimited Transactions**: If the price on day `i` is higher than the price on day `i-1`, the difference (`prices[i] - prices[i - 1]`) is added to `maxProfit`. This is equivalent to buying on day `i-1` and selling on day `i`.

```cpp
            return maxProfit;
        }
```
- **Return Max Profit for Unlimited Transactions**: After the loop, the total `maxProfit` is returned if `k` is large enough to treat it as an unlimited transaction scenario.

```cpp
        vector<vector<int>> dp(k + 1, vector<int>(n, 0));
```
- **DP Table Initialization**: A 2D vector `dp` is initialized with dimensions `(k + 1) x n`, where `dp[i][j]` will store the maximum profit achievable with `i` transactions by day `j`. All values are initially set to 0.

```cpp
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) {
            int maxDiff = -prices[0];
            for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
```
- **Outer Loop (Transactions)**: This loop iterates over the number of transactions from 1 to `k`.
- **Track Maximum Difference**: A variable `maxDiff` is initialized with `-prices[0]`, representing the best profit from buying a stock up to the previous day and selling it today.

```cpp
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j - 1], prices[j] + maxDiff);
```
- **Update DP Table**: For each day `j`, update the DP table entry `dp[i][j]` with the maximum profit achievable by either:
  - Not making a transaction on day `j` (`dp[i][j - 1]`).
  - Selling on day `j` after buying on an earlier day (`prices[j] + maxDiff`).

```cpp
                maxDiff = max(maxDiff, dp[i - 1][j] - prices[j]);
```
- **Update Max Difference**: `maxDiff` is updated to track the best possible profit for future transactions, considering the maximum profit up to the previous day (`dp[i-1][j]`) minus the current price (`prices[j]`).

```cpp
        return dp[k][n - 1];
    }
};
```
- **Return Final Result**: After filling the DP table, the function returns the maximum profit possible with `k` transactions by the last day (`dp[k][n-1]`).

This code efficiently calculates the maximum profit that can be achieved with up to `k` transactions using dynamic programming. It handles both small `k` values (where limited transactions are allowed) and large `k` values (where transactions are effectively unlimited).

### How the Code Works:

1. **Edge Case Handling:** If `k` is large enough (greater than half the number of days), treat it as an unlimited transaction problem.
2. **DP Array:** The 2D DP array `dp[i][j]` tracks the maximum profit for each transaction `i` up to day `j`.
3. **Profit Calculation:** For each transaction level `i`, the inner loop calculates the maximum profit by either skipping a transaction or making one.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is `O(k * n)`, where `k` is the number of transactions and `n` is the number of days.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is `O(k * n)` due to the DP table.

# 188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV

## Topics
- Companies

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer `k`.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most `k` transactions: i.e. you may buy at most `k` times and sell at most `k` times.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

## Example 1:

**Input:** 
```
k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
```
**Output:** 
```
2
```
**Explanation:** 
Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.

## Example 2:

**Input:** 
```
k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
```
**Output:** 
```
7
```
**Explanation:** 
Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.

## Constraints:

- `1 <= k <= 100`
- `1 <= prices.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 1000`

# Max Profit with at Most K Transactions

The idea of this thread was originally proposed by @yishiluo in the [LeetCode discussion](https://leetcode.com/discuss/26745/c-solution-with-o-n-klgn-time-using-max-heap-and-stack).

## General Idea

We use the term "valley" to denote a local minimum index of prices, and the term "peak" to denote a local maximum index of prices. Let `(v1, p1)` and `(v2, p2)` denote two successive valley-peak pairs of the prices, respectively. Consider the two cases:

### Case 1

If `prices[v1] <= prices[v2]` and `prices[p1] <= prices[p2]`, then:

- If we can conduct one transaction, we will use `(v1, p2)`.
- If we can conduct two transactions, we will use `(v1, p1)` and `(v2, p2)`.

Equivalently, we can consider `(v1, p2)` as one transaction opportunity, and `(v2, p1)` as another transaction opportunity. The key idea is that these two original valley-peak pairs provide two transaction opportunities: `(v1, p2)` and `(v2, p1)`.

### Case 2

If `prices[v1] >= prices[v2]` or `prices[p1] >= prices[p2]`, then:

- If we can conduct one transaction, we will use either `(v1, p1)` or `(v2, p2)`.
- If we can conduct two transactions, we will use both `(v1, p1)` and `(v2, p2)`.

That is, these two valley-peak pairs provide two transaction opportunities: `(v1, p1)` and `(v2, p2)`.

## Algorithm

The algorithm consists of two steps:

### Step 1: Find All Transaction Opportunities

- Record their profits.
- We use a stack `vps` to store the valley-peak pairs of the stock prices, wherein the valley value is sorted in ascending order (the valley value at the top of the stack is the largest).
- The profit of all transaction opportunities is recorded in the vector `profits`.
- The time complexity of this step is `O(n)`.

### Step 2: Find the K Most Profitable Transaction Opportunities

- The maximum profit we can get is the summation of the k opportunity.
- The time complexity of this step is `O(n)`.

### Overall Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n)`
- **Space:** worst-case `O(n)`

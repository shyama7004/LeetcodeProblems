# 238. Product of Array Except Self

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

## Example 1:

**Input:** `nums = [1,2,3,4]`

**Output:** `[24,12,8,6]`

## Example 2:

**Input:** `nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]`

**Output:** `[0,0,9,0,0]`

## Constraints:

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-30 <= nums[i] <= 30`
- The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

## Follow-up:

Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

## My Nala approach(some what right;-})
```cpp
int n = nums.size();

vector<int> leftproduct (n,0);
vector<int> rightproduct (n,0);

int product = 1;

for(int i = 0;i<n;i++)
{
	if(i >= 0)
	{
		leftproduct = product*nums[i-1];
		i--;
	}

	if(i<n)
	{
		righttproduct = product*nums[i+1];
		i++;
	}
}
return leftproduct*rightproduct;
```

Your approach contains some logical and syntactical errors. Let's correct it and discuss the correct approach along with the time and space complexity.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem "Product of Array Except Self", you can follow these steps:

1. **Initialize Two Arrays**: `leftProduct` and `rightProduct` to store the products of all the elements to the left and right of each index respectively.
2. **Compute Left Products**: Traverse the array from left to right and fill `leftProduct`.
3. **Compute Right Products**: Traverse the array from right to left and fill `rightProduct`.
4. **Compute the Result**: Multiply `leftProduct` and `rightProduct` for each index to get the final result.

However, the above approach uses extra space for `leftProduct` and `rightProduct`, and we can optimize it to use only one extra array for the result.

### Optimized Approach

1. **Initialize a Result Array**: `result` to store the final product except self.
2. **Compute Left Products in Result Array**: Use the result array to store the left products.
3. **Compute Right Products on the Fly**: Use a variable to store the right product and multiply it with the current value in the result array.

Here's the corrected and optimized code:

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> productExceptSelf(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    std::vector<int> result(n, 1);
    
    // Compute left products and store in result
    int leftProduct = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        result[i] = leftProduct;
        leftProduct *= nums[i];
    }
    
    // Compute right products and multiply with the current result
    int rightProduct = 1;
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        result[i] *= rightProduct;
        rightProduct *= nums[i];
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **First Loop**: We compute the left product for each element and store it in the result array. `result[i]` will have the product of all elements to the left of `i`.
2. **Second Loop**: We compute the right product for each element and multiply it with the current value in the result array. This way, `result[i]` will have the product of all elements except `nums[i]`.

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - We traverse the array twice (once for the left products and once for the right products).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) (excluding the space for the output array)
  - We use a constant amount of extra space for the left and right products. The result array is not considered extra space as it is the required output.

This solution is efficient and meets the requirements of the problem.

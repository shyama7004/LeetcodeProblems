# 1137. N-th Tribonacci Number

## Problem Statement

The Tribonacci sequence `Tn` is defined as follows: 

- `T0 = 0`
- `T1 = 1`
- `T2 = 1`
- `Tn+3 = Tn + Tn+1 + Tn+2` for `n >= 0`

Given `n`, return the value of `Tn`.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `n = 4`  
**Output:** `4`  
**Explanation:**  
- `T3 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2`  
- `T4 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4`

### Example 2

**Input:** `n = 25`  
**Output:** `1389537`

## Constraints

- `0 <= n <= 37`
- The answer is guaranteed to fit within a 32-bit integer, i.e., `answer <= 2^31 - 1`.

## Hints
- Same concept as `fibonacci`.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int tribonacci(int n) {
        if(n == 0) return 0;
        if (n == 1 || n == 2) return 1;
        
        int a = 0 ,b = 1, c = 1;

        for(int i = 3;i<=n;++i)
        {
            int next = a+b+c;
            a = b;
            b = c;
            c = next;
        }
        return c;
    }
};
```
## Explanation
```cpp
        if(n == 0) return 0;
        if (n == 1 || n == 2) return 1;
```
- **Explanation**: These are base cases for the Tribonacci sequence. 
  - If `n` is `0`, the function returns `0` immediately.
  - If `n` is `1` or `n` is `2`, the function returns `1` immediately.
  
  These conditions handle the smallest cases in the Tribonacci sequence, where:
  - `tribonacci(0) = 0`
  - `tribonacci(1) = 1`
  - `tribonacci(2) = 1`

```cpp
        int a = 0, b = 1, c = 1;
```
- **Explanation**: Three integers, `a`, `b`, and `c`, are initialized. 
  - `a` represents `tribonacci(0)` (i.e., 0),
  - `b` represents `tribonacci(1)` (i.e., 1),
  - `c` represents `tribonacci(2)` (i.e., 1). 

  These variables will be used to store the last three Tribonacci numbers as we compute the next one.

```cpp
        for(int i = 3; i <= n; ++i)
        {
```
- **Explanation**: A `for` loop starts from `i = 3` and runs until `i` is equal to `n`. This loop will calculate the Tribonacci numbers iteratively from `tribonacci(3)` up to `tribonacci(n)`.

```cpp
            int next = a + b + c;
```
- **Explanation**: Inside the loop, `next` is calculated as the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the last three Tribonacci numbers. This gives the next Tribonacci number in the sequence.

```cpp
            a = b;
            b = c;
            c = next;
```
- **Explanation**: After computing the next Tribonacci number:
  - `a` takes the value of `b` (the second last Tribonacci number),
  - `b` takes the value of `c` (the last Tribonacci number),
  - `c` takes the value of `next` (the newly calculated Tribonacci number).

  This step effectively shifts the window of the last three Tribonacci numbers forward.

```cpp
        }
```
- **Explanation**: The loop ends here. After the loop finishes, `c` will hold the value of `tribonacci(n)`.

```cpp
        return c;
```
- **Explanation**: The function returns `c`, which now contains the Tribonacci number at position `n`.

```cpp
    }
};
```
- **Explanation**: The class and function definitions end here.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this function is **O(n)** because the loop runs `n-2` times, which simplifies to `O(n)`.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity of this function is **O(1)**. The function uses a constant amount of space regardless of the input size, as it only uses a few integer variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `next`).

### Summary

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

### Intuition of this Problem

The Tribonacci sequence is defined as:
\[ T[n] = T[n-1] + T[n-2] + T[n-3] \]

### Approach

1. **Initialize** a vector `Tribonacci` with `n+1` elements.
2. **Check** if `n` is 0, return 0.
3. **Check** if `n` is 1, return 1.
4. **Check** if `n` is 2, return 1.
5. **Set** `Tribonacci[0] = 0`, `Tribonacci[1] = 1`, `Tribonacci[2] = 1`.
6. **Iterate** from `i = 3` to `n+1`.
7. **Set** `Tribonacci[i] = Tribonacci[i-1] + Tribonacci[i-2] + Tribonacci[i-3]`.
8. **Return** `Tribonacci[n]`.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int tribonacci(int n) {
        if(n == 0)
            return 0;
        if(n == 1 || n == 2)
            return 1;
        vector<int> Tribonacci(n+1);
        Tribonacci[0] = 0;
        Tribonacci[1] = 1;
        Tribonacci[2] = 1;
        for(int i = 3; i < n+1; i++){
            Tribonacci[i] = Tribonacci[i-1] + Tribonacci[i-2] + Tribonacci[i-3];
        }
        return Tribonacci[n];
    }
};
```

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\) (due to the extra space used by the vector)

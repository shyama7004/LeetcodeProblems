# 442. Find All Duplicates in an Array

## Problem Statement
- Companies :Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Adobe


Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` where all the integers of `nums` are in the range `[1, n]` and each integer appears once or twice, return an array of all the integers that appear twice.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and uses only constant extra space.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:** `nums = [4, 3, 2, 7, 8, 2, 3, 1]`  
**Output:** `[2, 3]`

### Example 2:

**Input:** `nums = [1, 1, 2]`  
**Output:** `[1]`

### Example 3:

**Input:** `nums = [1]`  
**Output:** `[]`

## Constraints

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
- Each element in `nums` appears once or twice.

### Your Nala solution(not so nala;) )
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findDuplicates(vector<int>& nums)
{sort(nums.begin(),nums.end());
vector<int> v;

for(int i = 0; i<nums.size();i++)
{
	int count = 1;
	while(i+1<nums.size() && nums[i] == nums[i+1])
	{
		count++;
		i++;
	}
	v.push_back(count);
}

sort(v.begin(),v.end());

for(int i = 0; i<v.size();i++)
{
	if(v[i] == 2) return v[i];
}
        
    }
};
```
### Issues and Debugging:

1. **Return Type Mismatch**:
   - The method `findDuplicates` is supposed to return a `vector<int>`, but within the method, you are returning an `int` when `v[i] == 2`. This will cause a compilation error.
   - **Solution**: If you want to return the first duplicate count of `2`, you should modify the return type or the logic to accumulate results in a vector and return that vector.

2. **Handling No Duplicates**:
   - If there are no elements with a count of `2`, the method will reach the end without returning anything, which leads to undefined behavior.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that the method returns something in all cases, such as an empty vector if no duplicates are found.

3. **Logic to Find Duplicates**:
   - The loop at the end is checking for `v[i] == 2` and returning it. If you are trying to return the elements in `nums` that have duplicates, you should modify this logic to return those elements instead of the count.

### Corrected Code:
Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the code that returns a vector of elements that appear exactly twice:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end()); // Sort the array
        vector<int> v; // Vector to store duplicate elements

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            int count = 1;

            // Count occurrences of the current element
            while (i + 1 < nums.size() && nums[i] == nums[i + 1]) {
                count++;
                i++;
            }

            // If the count is exactly 2, add the element to the result vector
            if (count == 2) {
                v.push_back(nums[i]);
            }
        }

        return v; // Return the vector of duplicates
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:

1. **Sorting**: The array `nums` is sorted to group identical elements together.
2. **Counting**: The inner loop counts occurrences of each element.
3. **Storing Duplicates**: If an element appears exactly twice, it is added to the vector `v`.
4. **Returning the Result**: The method returns the vector `v` containing all elements that appear exactly twice.

### Example:
- If the input is `[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]`, the output will be `[2, 3]` since `2` and `3` are the elements that appear exactly twice.


## Top voted solution

## Intuition
To solve this problem efficiently in `O(n)` time and with constant extra space, we can utilize the property that all integers in the array are within the range `[1, n]`. Given that each integer appears either once or twice, we can iterate through the array and use the value of each element as an index to mark the corresponding element in the array as negative. If we encounter an element that is already negative, it indicates that we have seen this element before, which means it is a duplicate.

## Approach
1. **Initialize an empty vector** `ans` to store the duplicates.
2. **Iterate through the array** `nums`.
3. For each element `nums[i]`, take its **absolute value** `x`.
4. **Check if** `nums[x-1]` **is negative**.
    - If it is, then `x` is a duplicate, so add it to `ans`.
    - Otherwise, mark `nums[x-1]` as negative to indicate that we have seen `x`.
5. **Return** `ans`.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` - We only iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(k)` - The additional space is used for storing duplicates in the `ans` vector, where `k` is the number of duplicates. The maximum value of `k` can be `n/2` if all elements are duplicated.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> ans;
        int n = nums.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int x = abs(nums[i]);
            
            if (nums[x-1] < 0) {
                ans.push_back(x);
            }
            
            nums[x-1] *= -1;
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```

---

### Explanation:
- **Marking with Negation**: By negating the value at the index `x-1`, we effectively mark that element as "seen." 
- **Checking for Duplicates**: If during the iteration, we encounter an element that points to an already negative value, we recognize that the corresponding element is a duplicate.
- **Efficiency**: The approach leverages the array itself to track occurrences, avoiding the need for extra space beyond the result vector.

This method efficiently finds all duplicates in an array with minimal space overhead, making it well-suited for large datasets.

# Finding Duplicates in a Vector using `map` and `unordered_map` in C++

## Using `map`

### Code Explanation

In C++, a `map` is an associative container that stores elements in a sorted order. The elements are stored as key-value pairs, where each key is unique, and values can be accessed using their corresponding keys.

### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        map<int, int> freqMap; // Map to store the frequency of each element
        vector<int> v; // Vector to store duplicate elements

        // Step 1: Count the frequency of each element in the array
        for (int num : nums) {
            freqMap[num]++;
        }

        // Step 2: Identify elements that occur exactly twice
        for (auto& [num, count] : freqMap) {
            if (count == 2) {
                v.push_back(num);
            }
        }

        return v; // Return the vector of duplicates
    }
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Frequency Counting:**
   - We iterate over the input vector `nums` and count the occurrences of each element using a `map`.
   - Since `map` maintains elements in a sorted order, insertion and lookup operations take \(O(\log n)\) time.

2. **Identifying Duplicates:**
   - After building the frequency map, we iterate over it to find elements that have a count of 2 (indicating that the element is a duplicate).

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n \log n)\) due to the logarithmic time complexity of `map` operations.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\) to store the frequencies of elements.

## Using `unordered_map`

### Code Explanation

`unordered_map` is another associative container, but unlike `map`, it does not store elements in a sorted order. Instead, it uses a hash table for storage, which allows for average constant-time complexity for insertion and lookup operations.

### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_map<int, int> freqMap; // Unordered map for frequency count
        vector<int> v; // Vector to store duplicate elements

        // Step 1: Count the frequency of each element in the array
        for (int num : nums) {
            freqMap[num]++;
        }

        // Step 2: Identify elements that occur exactly twice
        for (auto& [num, count] : freqMap) {
            if (count == 2) {
                v.push_back(num);
            }
        }

        return v; // Return the vector of duplicates
    }
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Frequency Counting:**
   - Similar to the `map` approach, but we use an `unordered_map` to count the occurrences of each element.
   - `unordered_map` provides average \(O(1)\) time complexity for insertion and lookup operations.

2. **Identifying Duplicates:**
   - We iterate over the `unordered_map` to find elements with a count of 2.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) because the average time complexity for `unordered_map` operations is constant.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\) for storing the frequency of elements.

## Conclusion

- The `map` implementation is correct and works well, but it has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\).
- The `unordered_map` implementation is more optimized with a time complexity of \(O(n)\), making it a better choice for handling larger datasets efficiently.

# 326. Power of Three

## Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, return `true` if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return `false`.

An integer `n` is a power of three if there exists an integer `x` such that `n == 3^x`.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:** `n = 27`  
**Output:** `true`  
**Explanation:** 27 = 3^3

### Example 2:
**Input:** `n = 0`  
**Output:** `false`  
**Explanation:** There is no `x` where 3^x = 0.

### Example 3:
**Input:** `n = -1`  
**Output:** `false`  
**Explanation:** There is no `x` where 3^x = -1.

## Constraints

- `-2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`

## Hints

- You can use while loop.

## Code 
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        if (n<1)
        {
            return false;
        }
        while(n%3 == 0)
        {
            n=n/3;
        }
        return n == 1;
    }
};
```
This code checks whether a given integer `n` is a power of three. Here's a detailed explanation of the code, line by line:

### Code Breakdown

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfThree(int n) {
```

- **`class Solution` and `public:`**:
  - This declares a class named `Solution` with public access. The `isPowerOfThree` function is a public member of this class.

- **`bool isPowerOfThree(int n)`**:
  - This defines a function named `isPowerOfThree` that takes an integer `n` as an argument and returns a boolean value (`true` or `false`).

---

```cpp
if (n < 1)
{
    return false;
}
```

- **`if (n < 1)`**:
  - This checks if the input `n` is less than 1. Powers of three are positive numbers greater than or equal to 1, so any value less than 1 cannot be a power of three.
  
- **`return false;`**:
  - If `n` is less than 1, the function returns `false` immediately, indicating that `n` is not a power of three.

---

```cpp
while (n % 3 == 0)
{
    n = n / 3;
}
```

- **`while (n % 3 == 0)`**:
  - This loop continues as long as `n` is divisible by 3, which means `n % 3` equals 0. The modulo operation `%` checks the remainder when `n` is divided by 3.
  - The logic here is to keep dividing `n` by 3 until `n` is no longer divisible by 3.

- **`n = n / 3;`**:
  - Inside the loop, `n` is updated to `n / 3`. This divides `n` by 3 and assigns the result back to `n`. The loop repeats this process, effectively removing all factors of 3 from `n`.

---

```cpp
return n == 1;
```

- **`return n == 1;`**:
  - After the loop, the function checks if `n` has been reduced to 1.
  - If `n` is equal to 1, this means that the original number `n` was a power of three (since dividing `n` repeatedly by 3 eventually reduced it to 1).
  - If `n` is not equal to 1, then `n` must have had a factor other than 3, so the function returns `false`.

### How It Works:

- **Example 1**: For `n = 27`:
  - 27 is divisible by 3, so the loop divides it by 3 (27/3 = 9).
  - 9 is divisible by 3, so the loop divides it by 3 again (9/3 = 3).
  - 3 is divisible by 3, so the loop divides it by 3 again (3/3 = 1).
  - Now `n` is 1, so the function returns `true`, confirming that 27 is a power of three.

- **Example 2**: For `n = 10`:
  - 10 is not divisible by 3 (10 % 3 ≠ 0), so the loop is never entered.
  - The function checks if `n == 1`, which is false, so the function returns `false`, confirming that 10 is not a power of three.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the `isPowerOfThree` function is **O(log₃(n))**.

- The while loop continues to divide `n` by 3 until `n` is no longer divisible by 3.
- The number of iterations of the loop is proportional to the number of times you can divide `n` by 3, which is approximately `log₃(n)`.
  - For example, if `n = 27`, you can divide it by 3 three times (27 -> 9 -> 3 -> 1), which corresponds to `log₃(27) = 3`.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of the `isPowerOfThree` function is **O(1)**.

- The function uses a constant amount of space regardless of the input size `n`.
- There are no data structures (like arrays, lists, etc.) being used that scale with the input size.
- Only a few variables (like `n`) are used, which do not depend on the input size.

### Summary

- **Time Complexity**: `O(log₃(n))`
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`

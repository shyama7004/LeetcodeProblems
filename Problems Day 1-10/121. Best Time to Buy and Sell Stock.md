# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** Arrays, Dynamic Programming  

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

## Example 1:

**Input:** `prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]`  
**Output:** `5`  
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6 - 1 = 5.  
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

## Example 2:

**Input:** `prices = [7,6,4,3,1]`  
**Output:** `0`  
**Explanation:** In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

## Constraints:

- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`


### Problem Explanation:
You are given an array `prices`, where `prices[i]` represents the price of a stock on the `i-th` day. The goal is to maximize the profit by choosing a single day to buy the stock and a different day in the future to sell it. You need to return the maximum profit that can be achieved. If no profit can be made, return `0`.

### Code Solution:
```cpp

int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
    int minPrice = INT_MAX;    // Initialize minPrice with the maximum possible integer value
    int maxProfit = 0;         // Initialize maxProfit to 0

    for (int i = 0; i < prices.size(); i++) {
        // Update minPrice if the current price is lower than the current minPrice
        if (prices[i] < minPrice) {
            minPrice = prices[i];
        }
        // Calculate potential profit if selling on day i
        int profit = prices[i] - minPrice;
        // Update maxProfit if the current profit is higher than the current maxProfit
        if (profit > maxProfit) {
            maxProfit = profit;
        }
    }
    
    return maxProfit;  // Return the maximum profit found
}


```

### Explanation of Each Line:

1. **`int minPrice = INT_MAX;`**: 
   - `minPrice` is initialized to the highest possible integer value. This ensures that any price in the array will be smaller than this initial value, allowing us to find the minimum price as we iterate through the array.

2. **`int maxProfit = 0;`**: 
   - `maxProfit` is initialized to `0`, as initially, no profit has been made.

3. **`for (int i = 0; i < prices.size(); i++)`**: 
   - This loop iterates over the entire `prices` array to evaluate potential profits.

4. **`if (prices[i] < minPrice) { minPrice = prices[i]; }`**: 
   - As we iterate, we check if the current price (`prices[i]`) is lower than the current `minPrice`. If so, we update `minPrice` with `prices[i]`.

5. **`int profit = prices[i] - minPrice;`**: 
   - Calculate the profit if we were to sell the stock on the `i-th` day after buying it on the day with the `minPrice`.

6. **`if (profit > maxProfit) { maxProfit = profit; }`**: 
   - Update `maxProfit` if the current profit is greater than the previously recorded `maxProfit`.

7. **`return maxProfit;`**: 
   - Return the maximum profit that was calculated during the iteration.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: The algorithm only requires a single pass through the `prices` array, where `n` is the length of the array.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.

# 191. Number of 1 Bits

### Write a function that takes the binary representation of a positive integer and returns the number of  set bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

 

<h3><strong>Example 1:</strong><h3>

> Input: n = 11<br>
Output: 3<br>
Explanation:<br>
The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.<br>

<h3><strong>Example 2:</strong></h3>

> Input: n = 128<br>
Output: 1<br>
Explanation:<br>
The input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit.<br>

<h3><strong>Example 3:</strong></h3>

> Input: n = 2147483645<br>
Output: 30<br>
Explanation:<br>
The input binary string 1111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty set bits.<br>

### Constraints:

`1 <= n <= 231 - 1`

## Hints
1. Convert to Binary.
2. Check the last digit,and right shift until `n=0`.

## Code 
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int num = 0;
        while(n !=0)
        {
            if(n&1)
            {
                num++;
            }
            n=n>>1;
        }
        return num;
        
    }
};
```

```cpp
int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
    int count = 0;
    
    while (n) {
        n &= (n - 1);
        count++;
    }
    
    return count;
}

### unsigned 32 bit integers

`uint32_t` is for unsigned 32 bit integers, meaning it stores values between 0 and 4294967295 and int32_t is for signed 32 bit integers, meaning it stores values between -2147483648 and 2147483647.

## Explanation

- n & (n - 1) drops the lowest set bit. It's a `neat little bit trick`.

- Let's use n = 00101100 as an example. This binary representation has three 1s.

- If n = 00101100, then n - 1 = 00101011, so n & (n - 1) = 00101100 & 00101011 = 00101000. Count = 1.

- If n = 00101000, then n - 1 = 00100111, so n & (n - 1) = 00101000 & 00100111 = 00100000. Count = 2.

- If n = 00100000, then n - 1 = 00011111, so n & (n - 1) = 00100000 & 00011111 = 00000000. Count = 3.

- n is now zero, so the while loop ends, and the final count (the numbers of set bits) is returned.

# 1780. Check if Number is a Sum of Powers of Three


## Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, return `true` if it is possible to represent `n` as the sum of distinct powers of three. Otherwise, return `false`.

An integer `y` is a power of three if there exists an integer `x` such that `y == 3^x`.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:** `n = 12`  
**Output:** `true`  
**Explanation:** 12 = 3^1 + 3^2

### Example 2:
**Input:** `n = 91`  
**Output:** `true`  
**Explanation:** 91 = 3^0 + 3^2 + 3^4

### Example 3:
**Input:** `n = 21`  
**Output:** `false`

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 10^7`

## Hints
- check for remainder = 2.

## Code

The problem asks whether a given integer `n` can be expressed as the sum of distinct powers of three. Here's the code to solve this problem:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkPowersOfThree(int n) {
        while (n > 0) {
            if (n % 3 == 2) {
                return false;
            }
            n /= 3;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Explanation (Line by Line)

#### 1. `class Solution {`
- **Purpose**: Declares a class named `Solution` that will contain the function to solve the problem.

#### 2. `public:`
- **Purpose**: Makes the following members of the class publicly accessible.

#### 3. `bool checkPowersOfThree(int n) {`
- **Purpose**: Defines a function named `checkPowersOfThree` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean (`true` or `false`).

#### 4. `while (n > 0) {`
- **Purpose**: Starts a loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.
- **Logic**: The loop iteratively reduces `n` by dividing it by 3 and checking its remainder.

#### 5. `if (n % 3 == 2) {`
- **Purpose**: Checks the remainder when `n` is divided by 3 using the modulo operation (`n % 3`).
- **Logic**: If `n % 3 == 2`, it means that `n` has a remainder of 2 when divided by 3.
  - **Reasoning**: If the remainder is `2`, then `n` cannot be represented as a sum of distinct powers of three because we can only use the remainders `0` and `1` (corresponding to whether a power of three is used or not).

#### 6. `return false;`
- **Purpose**: If the remainder is `2`, the function returns `false` immediately, indicating that `n` cannot be represented as the sum of distinct powers of three.

#### 7. `n /= 3;`
- **Purpose**: Divides `n` by 3 and updates its value.
- **Logic**: This operation reduces `n` for the next iteration of the loop, allowing the function to check the next digit in the base-3 representation of `n`.

#### 8. `}`
- **Purpose**: Closes the `while` loop block.

#### 9. `return true;`
- **Purpose**: If the loop completes without returning `false`, the function returns `true`.
- **Logic**: If none of the remainders were `2`, then `n` can be expressed as the sum of distinct powers of three.

#### 10. `}`
- **Purpose**: Closes the function block.

#### 11. `};`
- **Purpose**: Closes the class block.

### Time Complexity

- **O(log₃(n))**: The while loop runs while `n > 0`, and `n` is divided by 3 in each iteration. The number of iterations required to reduce `n` to 0 is proportional to `log₃(n)`.

### Space Complexity

- **O(1)**: The function uses a constant amount of space regardless of the size of `n`. There are no additional data structures or variables that scale with the input size.

### Summary

- **Time Complexity**: `O(log₃(n))`
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`

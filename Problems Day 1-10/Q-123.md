# 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.

**Note**: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**: `prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]`

**Output**: `6`

**Explanation**: 
- Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
- Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

### Example 2

**Input**: `prices = [1,2,3,4,5]`

**Output**: `4`

**Explanation**: 
- Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
- Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2, and sell them later, as you are engaging in multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

### Example 3

**Input**: `prices = [7,6,4,3,1]`

**Output**: `0`

**Explanation**: 
- In this case, no transaction is done, i.e., max profit = 0.

## Constraints

- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^5`

## Your Nala Code

```cpp

int minprice = INT_MAX;
int maxProfit = 0;
int maxProfit2 = 0;

for(int i = 0; i<prices.size(); i++)
{
	if(prices[i]<minPrice)
	{
		minPrice = prices[i];
	}
	
int profit = prices[i] - minPrice;

	if(profit>maxProfit)
	{
		maxprofit = profit;
	}

	if(profit>maxProfit2)&(maxProfit != maxProfit2))
	{
		maxprofit2 = profit;
	}
}
return maxProfit + maxProfit2;
```
The code you provided is attempting to solve the LeetCode problem 123 ("Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III"), but it won't work correctly for this problem. The problem asks you to find the maximum profit you can achieve by making at most two transactions, where you buy and sell a stock. Your code has some issues that prevent it from solving the problem correctly:

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Misuse of Variables**: The code attempts to find the maximum profit from two transactions, but it only updates `maxProfit2` if `profit` is greater than `maxProfit` and not equal to `maxProfit2`. This logic won't correctly track the two separate transactions.

2. **Only One Transaction Considered**: The code doesn't correctly account for two separate transactions. It only tracks the maximum profit so far, but it doesn't handle the scenario where the profit from a second transaction (after the first sale and another buy) could lead to a higher overall profit.

3. **Logical Errors**: The condition `if(profit>maxProfit2) & (maxProfit != maxProfit2)` is problematic. The `&` operator should be `&&` for a logical AND, but even with this correction, the logic won't correctly handle the separation of the two transactions.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to use dynamic programming or a more systematic approach. The idea is to calculate the maximum profit from both the left side (up to each day) and the right side (starting from each day).

Here's a correct implementation using dynamic programming:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        if (prices.empty()) return 0;

        int n = prices.size();
        vector<int> leftProfits(n, 0);  // Max profit if we sell on or before day i
        vector<int> rightProfits(n, 0); // Max profit if we buy on or after day i

        // Calculate leftProfits (max profit with one transaction from the start to i)
        int minPrice = prices[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            minPrice = min(minPrice, prices[i]);
            leftProfits[i] = max(leftProfits[i-1], prices[i] - minPrice);
        }

        // Calculate rightProfits (max profit with one transaction from i to the end)
        int maxPrice = prices[n-1];
        for (int i = n-2; i >= 0; i--) {
            maxPrice = max(maxPrice, prices[i]);
            rightProfits[i] = max(rightProfits[i+1], maxPrice - prices[i]);
        }

        // Combine the two results
        int maxProfit = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            maxProfit = max(maxProfit, leftProfits[i] + rightProfits[i]);
        }

        return maxProfit;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
1. **leftProfits**: This array stores the maximum profit that can be made if you sell on or before day `i`.
2. **rightProfits**: This array stores the maximum profit that can be made if you buy on or after day `i`.
3. **Final Calculation**: The maximum profit with at most two transactions is the maximum value of `leftProfits[i] + rightProfits[i]` for any day `i`.

### Example:
For an input array `[3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]`, the algorithm will correctly find that the maximum profit is `6`, which comes from buying on day 4, selling on day 6, and then buying on day 7 and selling on day 8.

This approach ensures that you account for up to two separate transactions, providing the correct solution to LeetCode problem 123.

## Line by Line Explanantion


### Code Breakdown

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
```
- This is the start of the `Solution` class, which contains the `maxProfit` function. This function will take a vector of integers `prices` (which represents the stock prices on different days) and return the maximum profit you can achieve with at most two transactions.

```cpp
        if (prices.empty()) return 0;
```
- **Check for Empty Input**: If the input vector `prices` is empty (i.e., there are no prices given), there's no way to make a profit, so the function immediately returns 0.

```cpp
        int n = prices.size();
```
- **Get the Size of the Array**: Here, `n` stores the number of days or the size of the `prices` vector. This is used later to loop through the prices.
- Here ,`0` represents the initiation.
```cpp
        vector<int> leftProfits(n, 0);  // Max profit if we sell on or before day i
        vector<int> rightProfits(n, 0); // Max profit if we buy on or after day i
```
- **Initialize Profit Arrays**:
  - `leftProfits`: This vector will store the maximum profit that can be obtained by making a single transaction and selling on or before day `i`.
  - `rightProfits`: This vector will store the maximum profit that can be obtained by making a single transaction and buying on or after day `i`.

  Both vectors are initialized to 0 because the profit is 0 if no transactions are made.

```cpp
        int minPrice = prices[0];
```
- **Initialize Minimum Price**: This variable keeps track of the minimum price encountered so far as you iterate through the `prices` array. It starts with the price on the first day (`prices[0]`).

```cpp
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            minPrice = min(minPrice, prices[i]);
            leftProfits[i] = max(leftProfits[i-1], prices[i] - minPrice);
        }
```
- **Calculate Left Profits**:
  - **Loop**: The loop iterates through the `prices` array starting from the second day (index 1) to the last day (index `n-1`).
  - **Update `minPrice`**: For each day `i`, update `minPrice` to be the minimum of the current `minPrice` and `prices[i]`. This keeps track of the lowest price encountered so far.
  - **Calculate Profit**: `prices[i] - minPrice` gives the profit if you were to buy at `minPrice` and sell on day `i`. The maximum profit up to day `i` is the maximum of the previous day's profit (`leftProfits[i-1]`) or selling on day `i` (`prices[i] - minPrice`).
  - **Store in `leftProfits`**: This value is stored in `leftProfits[i]`, meaning it records the best profit possible up to day `i`.

```cpp
        int maxPrice = prices[n-1];
```
- **Initialize Maximum Price**: This variable keeps track of the maximum price encountered so far as you iterate backward through the `prices` array. It starts with the price on the last day (`prices[n-1]`).

```cpp
        for (int i = n-2; i >= 0; i--) {
            maxPrice = max(maxPrice, prices[i]);
            rightProfits[i] = max(rightProfits[i+1], maxPrice - prices[i]);
        }
```
- **Calculate Right Profits**:
  - **Loop**: The loop iterates through the `prices` array starting from the second-to-last day (index `n-2`) to the first day (index `0`).
  - **Update `maxPrice`**: For each day `i`, update `maxPrice` to be the maximum of the current `maxPrice` and `prices[i]`. This keeps track of the highest price encountered so far.
  - **Calculate Profit**: `maxPrice - prices[i]` gives the profit if you were to buy on day `i` and sell at `maxPrice`. The maximum profit from day `i` to the end is the maximum of the next day's profit (`rightProfits[i+1]`) or buying on day `i` and selling at `maxPrice` (`maxPrice - prices[i]`).
  - **Store in `rightProfits`**: This value is stored in `rightProfits[i]`, meaning it records the best profit possible from day `i` onwards.

```cpp
        int maxProfit = 0;
```
- **Initialize Maximum Profit**: This variable will store the maximum profit that can be achieved with at most two transactions.

```cpp
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            maxProfit = max(maxProfit, leftProfits[i] + rightProfits[i]);
        }
```
- **Combine Results**:
  - **Loop**: This loop iterates through each day from the first to the last.
  - **Combine Profits**: For each day `i`, the combined profit is `leftProfits[i] + rightProfits[i]`, which represents the best profit if you make one transaction up to day `i` and another starting from day `i`.
  - **Update `maxProfit`**: The maximum of `maxProfit` and the combined profit is stored back in `maxProfit`. This ensures that `maxProfit` always holds the highest possible profit with at most two transactions.

```cpp
        return maxProfit;
    }
};
```
- **Return the Result**: Finally, the function returns `maxProfit`, which is the maximum profit that can be achieved with at most two transactions.

### Summary:
- **`leftProfits`** tracks the maximum profit from the start to each day.
- **`rightProfits`** tracks the maximum profit from each day to the end.
- The combination of `leftProfits[i] + rightProfits[i]` gives the maximum profit possible with two transactions, considering the best scenario of selling the first stock on or before day `i` and buying the second stock on or after day `i`.
- The final result is the highest combined profit found across all possible split points.

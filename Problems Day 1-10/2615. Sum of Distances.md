# 2615. Sum of Distances

## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. There exists an array `arr` of length `nums.length`, where `arr[i]` is the sum of `|i - j|` over all `j` such that `nums[j] == nums[i]` and `j != i`. If there is no such `j`, set `arr[i]` to be `0`.

Return the array `arr`.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:** `nums = [1,3,1,1,2]`  
**Output:** `[5,0,3,4,0]`  
**Explanation:**  
- When `i = 0`, `nums[0] == nums[2]` and `nums[0] == nums[3]`. Therefore, `arr[0] = |0 - 2| + |0 - 3| = 5`.
- When `i = 1`, `arr[1] = 0` because there is no other index with value 3.
- When `i = 2`, `nums[2] == nums[0]` and `nums[2] == nums[3]`. Therefore, `arr[2] = |2 - 0| + |2 - 3| = 3`.
- When `i = 3`, `nums[3] == nums[0]` and `nums[3] == nums[2]`. Therefore, `arr[3] = |3 - 0| + |3 - 2| = 4`.
- When `i = 4`, `arr[4] = 0` because there is no other index with value 2.

### Example 2:
**Input:** `nums = [0,5,3]`  
**Output:** `[0,0,0]`  
**Explanation:** Since each element in `nums` is distinct, `arr[i] = 0` for all `i`.

## Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## My not so nala code(TLE margaya , I haven't studied maps ;))

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    vector<long long> distance(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<long long> arr;
        int n = nums.size();
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            long long sum = 0;  // Use long long for sum
            
            for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {  // Start j from 0 to compare all elements
                if(nums[i] == nums[j]) {
                    sum += abs(i - j);
                }
            }
            
            arr.push_back(sum);  // Add sum to arr after finishing the inner loop
        }
        
        return arr;  // Return the entire vector after all calculations
    }
};
```

## Optimized Solution

### Intuitive Approach

#### Problem Understanding:
You're trying to calculate the sum of distances between each occurrence of the same number in a list. The brute-force method (using nested loops) was too slow, so we needed a more efficient approach.

#### Intuition Behind the Optimized Approach:

1. **Break Down the Problem:**
   - For each element in the list, you need to find the sum of the absolute differences between its index and the indices of all other occurrences of the same element.

2. **Observing Patterns:**
   - If you know how many times a number has appeared before and the sum of the indices where it appeared, you can quickly calculate its contribution to the distance.
   - Similarly, if you know how many times it will appear after the current index, you can adjust the total distance accordingly.

3. **Efficient Calculation:**
   - Instead of recalculating distances from scratch for every element (which is slow), keep track of some cumulative information:
     - **Count of occurrences**: How many times has this number appeared so far?
     - **Sum of indices**: What is the sum of indices where this number has appeared so far?
       
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<long long> distance(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<long long> result(n, 0);
        unordered_map<int, long long> count, sum;
        
        // First pass: left to right
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (count.find(nums[i]) != count.end()) {
                result[i] += count[nums[i]] * i - sum[nums[i]];
            }
            count[nums[i]]++;
            sum[nums[i]] += i;
        }
        
        count.clear();
        sum.clear();
        
        // Second pass: right to left
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (count.find(nums[i]) != count.end()) {
                result[i] += sum[nums[i]] - count[nums[i]] * i;
            }
            count[nums[i]]++;
            sum[nums[i]] += i;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```


## Code Explanation
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to calculate the sum of distances for each element in the nums array
    vector<long long> distance(vector<int>& nums) {
```

- This is the definition of the `Solution` class and its member function `distance`.
- The function takes a reference to a vector of integers `nums` and returns a vector of `long long` integers.

```cpp
        int n = nums.size();
```

- This line retrieves the size of the `nums` vector and stores it in the integer variable `n`.

```cpp
        vector<long long> result(n, 0);
```

- This creates a vector `result` of size `n`, initialized with zeros.
- The `result` vector will store the sum of distances for each element in `nums`.

```cpp
        unordered_map<int, long long> count, sum;
```

- Two `unordered_map` objects `count` and `sum` are declared.
- `count` will store how many times each number has appeared so far.
- `sum` will store the sum of the indices where each number has appeared.

`Note` : Check how it's stored.
```
[3 -->  1, 4, 6, 8]
```

```cpp
        // First pass: left to right
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
```

- This is the beginning of a loop that iterates from the left (index `0`) to the right (index `n-1`) of the `nums` vector.

```cpp
            if (count.find(nums[i]) != count.end()) {
                result[i] += count[nums[i]] * i - sum[nums[i]];
            }
```

- The `if` condition checks if the current number `nums[i]` has been encountered before by looking for it in the `count` map.
- If it has been encountered (`count.find(nums[i]) != count.end()`), the code calculates the contribution to the distance:
  - `count[nums[i]] * i` gives the sum of distances considering how many times `nums[i]` has appeared before and its current index.
  - `sum[nums[i]]` is subtracted to remove the previous sum of indices from the result.
- The result is added to `result[i]`, which stores the cumulative distance for the current element.

```cpp
            count[nums[i]]++;
            sum[nums[i]] += i;
```

- The count of `nums[i]` is incremented by `1` in the `count` map.
- The index `i` is added to the `sum` map for the current number `nums[i]`.

```cpp
        count.clear();
        sum.clear();
```

- After the first pass from left to right, the `count` and `sum` maps are cleared to prepare for the second pass.
- Clearing these maps removes the previous data so that you can start fresh from the right side.

```cpp
        // Second pass: right to left
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
```

- This is the beginning of a loop that iterates from the right (index `n-1`) to the left (index `0`) of the `nums` vector.

```cpp
            if (count.find(nums[i]) != count.end()) {
                result[i] += sum[nums[i]] - count[nums[i]] * i;
            }
```

- The `if` condition checks if the current number `nums[i]` has been encountered before in this second pass.
- If it has, the code calculates the contribution to the distance:
  - `sum[nums[i]]` gives the sum of indices where `nums[i]` has appeared so far.
  - `count[nums[i]] * i` is subtracted to adjust the distance considering the current index.
- The result is added to `result[i]`, continuing to accumulate the distance for each element.

```cpp
            count[nums[i]]++;
            sum[nums[i]] += i;
```

- The count of `nums[i]` is incremented by `1` in the `count` map.
- The index `i` is added to the `sum` map for the current number `nums[i]`.

```cpp
        return result;
    }
};
```

- After both passes, the function returns the `result` vector, which now contains the sum of distances for each element in the `nums` array.

### Summary:
- The code optimizes the calculation of distances between identical elements in `nums` by processing the list twice (left to right and right to left).
- It uses `unordered_map` to keep track of how often each number has appeared and the sum of the indices where they appeared, allowing for an efficient calculation of distances without needing a nested loop.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\) because each pass (left to right and right to left) is linear in time, and map operations like insertion and lookup are average \(O(1)\).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) because of the space used by the `count` and `sum` maps, which can store information for up to `n` elements in the worst case.

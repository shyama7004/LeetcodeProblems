# 448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array

## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of `n` integers where `nums[i]` is in the range `[1, n]`, return an array of all the integers in the range `[1, n]` that do not appear in `nums`.

## Example 1:
**Input:** 
```plaintext
nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
```
**Output:** 
```plaintext
[5, 6]
```

## Example 2:
**Input:** 
```plaintext
nums = [1,1]
```
**Output:** 
```plaintext
[2]
```

## Constraints:
- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`

## Follow Up:
Could you do it without extra space and in `O(n)` runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.

## My nala code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findDisappearedNumbers(vector<int>& nums) {

	vector<int> n ;

	for(int i = 1;i<nums.size();i++){
		
		vector<int > v;
		if(i != nums[i])
		{
			v = nums[i];
		} 
	n.push_back(v);
			
        
    }
return n;
    }

};
```
Your code has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Indexing**: 
   - The loop starts at `i = 1`, which skips the first element of the array. You should start from `i = 0` to include all elements.
   - When checking the condition `if(i != nums[i])`, you should remember that array indices start at `0`, but the numbers you are dealing with are in the range `[1, n]`.

2. **Vector Assignment**:
   - The line `v = nums[i];` is incorrect because `v` is a vector, while `nums[i]` is an integer. You probably meant to add the number `i + 1` to the result vector if it is missing in `nums`.

3. **Logic Issue**:
   - The approach to finding the missing numbers is incorrect. The goal is to find numbers from `1` to `n` that are missing in the array `nums`. The logic should reflect that.

Let's correct the code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findDisappearedNumbers(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> result;
        int n = nums.size();

        // Mark the existing numbers by flipping the sign of the value at the index nums[i] - 1
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int index = abs(nums[i]) - 1;  // Convert to 0-based index
            if (nums[index] > 0) {
                nums[index] = -nums[index];
            }
        }

        // Find the indices that have positive values, those are the missing numbers
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > 0) {
                result.push_back(i + 1);  // Convert back to 1-based index
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

### Explanation

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `findDisappearedNumbers` that finds all the numbers in a given array `nums` that are missing from the range `[1, n]`, where `n` is the size of the array. Hereâ€™s a line-by-line explanation:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findDisappearedNumbers(vector<int>& nums) {
```
- This line defines a class named `Solution` and a public method `findDisappearedNumbers`. The method takes a reference to a vector of integers (`vector<int>& nums`) and returns a vector of integers.

```cpp
        vector<int> result;
```
- This declares an empty vector `result` that will store the missing numbers found in the array `nums`.

```cpp
        int n = nums.size();
```
- This line initializes an integer `n` with the size of the vector `nums`, which represents the number of elements in the array.

```cpp
        // Mark the existing numbers by flipping the sign of the value at the index nums[i] - 1
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
```
- This starts a `for` loop that will iterate over each element in the `nums` array from index `0` to `n-1`.

```cpp
            int index = abs(nums[i]) - 1;  // Convert to 0-based index
```
- For each element `nums[i]`, this line calculates the corresponding index `index` in the array by taking the absolute value of `nums[i]`, subtracting `1` (to convert it from 1-based to 0-based index). 

```cpp
            if (nums[index] > 0) {
                nums[index] = -nums[index];
            }
```
- This block checks if the value at `nums[index]` is positive. If it is, it flips the sign of `nums[index]` to mark that the number `index + 1` exists in the array. Flipping the sign ensures that any number that appears in `nums` is marked.

```cpp
        }
```
- This closes the first `for` loop.

```cpp
        // Find the indices that have positive values, those are the missing numbers
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
```
- This starts a second `for` loop that again iterates through the array `nums`.

```cpp
            if (nums[i] > 0) {
                result.push_back(i + 1);  // Convert back to 1-based index
            }
```
- For each element `nums[i]`, this block checks if the value is still positive. A positive value indicates that the number `i + 1` was missing in the original array. If so, the number `i + 1` is added to the `result` vector.

```cpp
        }
```
- This closes the second `for` loop.

```cpp
        return result;
```
- The method returns the `result` vector, which contains all the numbers missing from the range `[1, n]`.

```cpp
    }
};
```
- This closes the method and the class definition.

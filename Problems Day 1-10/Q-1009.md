# 1009. Complement of Base 10 Integer

### The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's in its binary representation.
### For example, The integer 5 is "101" in binary and its complement is "010" which is the integer 2.
### Given an integer n, return its complement.

 

<h3>Example 1:<h3>

> Input: n = 5<br>
Output: 2<br>
Explanation: 5 is "101" in binary, with complement "010" in binary, which is 2 in base-10.<br>

<h3>Example 2:</h3>

> Input: n = 7<br>
Output: 0<br>
Explanation: 7 is "111" in binary, with complement "000" in binary, which is 0 in base-10.

<h3>Example 3:</h3>

> Input: n = 10<br>
Output: 5<br>
Explanation: 10 is "1010" in binary, with complement "0101" in binary, which is 5 in base-10.
 

### Constraints:

`0 <= n < 109`

## Logic
- If n = 5 i.e 00000.....101.
- If ~n = ~5 i.e 1111....10`10`.

Our answer is only the last two digits.But how to remove all the ones?
- We make a mask to solve this problem i.e 000...111,why `three` one ?
As in representation of 101 ,3rd digit is 1:)
- If we `&` this mask with ~n
Answer = 000...0010

#### How to create this mask?
If n = 5 --> 000...00101
 - mask  --> 000...00111

What we do is ,right shift `n`.
- 00..0101 --> 1st 000...0010=> ! =0<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;--> 2nd 00...0001=> ! =0<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;--> 3rd 00...0000=> ! =0

The problem here is how do we run this loop for 3 times.

To solve this we just `initialize` the mask from `mask =0`.<br>
And then we just left shift.

What if `n! = 0`?

## Code


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int bitwiseComplement(int n) {
        // Special case for n=0, as its complement is 1
        if (n == 0) return 1; 
        
        int mask = 0;
        int temp = n;
        
        // Create the mask with the same number of bits as n
        // This loop shifts the mask left and sets the least significant bit to 1
        // until temp becomes 0.
        while (temp != 0) {
            mask = (mask << 1) | 1;
            temp = temp >> 1;
        }
        
        // XOR n with mask to get the complement
        // ~n flips all bits of n, & mask ensures we only consider relevant bits
        int complement = (~n) & mask;
        
        return complement;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Special Case for Zero**:
   - `if (n == 0) return 1;` handles the special case where `n` is `0`. The complement of `0` is `1`.

2. **Mask Creation**:
   - `int mask = 0;` initializes the mask to `0`.
   - `int temp = n;` uses a temporary variable `temp` to create the mask without modifying `n`.
   - The `while (temp != 0)` loop iterates through each bit of `temp`. In each iteration, the mask is left-shifted by 1 (`mask << 1`) and the least significant bit is set to `1` (`| 1`).
   - `temp = temp >> 1;` right-shifts `temp` by 1 to process the next bit.
   - This loop continues until all bits of `temp` are processed, creating a mask with the same number of bits as `n`.

3. **Calculate Complement**:
   - `int complement = (~n) & mask;` calculates the complement.
     - `~n` flips all bits of `n`.
     - `& mask` ensures that only the relevant bits are considered by performing a bitwise AND with the mask.
   
4. **Return the Complement**:
   - The result, `complement`, is the complement of the input integer `n`.

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  int bitwiseComplement(int N) {
    int mask = 1;

    while (mask < N)
      mask = (mask << 1) + 1;

    return mask ^ N;
  }
};
```


### Explanation

The code begins by declaring an integer variable `mask` and initializing it to 1. This `mask` will be used to create a binary number where all bits are set to 1, matching the bit length of the input number `N`.

The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as `mask` is less than or equal to `N`. Inside the loop, `mask` undergoes a left shift operation (`mask << 1`), which shifts the binary representation of `mask` one position to the left. This operation is equivalent to multiplying `mask` by 2. For example, if `mask` is initially 1 (binary `001`), after this operation, it becomes 2 (binary `010`).

Following the left shift, `1` is added to `mask`, which sets the least significant bit (the rightmost bit) of `mask` to 1, while all other bits remain unchanged. For instance, if `mask` was 2 (binary `010`) after the left shift, it becomes 3 (binary `011`) after adding 1.

This process continues until `mask` becomes a binary number with all bits set to 1, having the same number of bits as `N`. For example, if `N` is 5 (binary `101`), `mask` will be 7 (binary `111`) at the end of the loop.

Finally, the code returns the result of the bitwise XOR (`^`) operation between `mask` and `N`. The bitwise XOR flips the bits in `N` wherever `mask` has 1s, effectively computing the bitwise complement of `N`. For instance, if `N` is 5 and `mask` is 7, the result will be 2 (binary `010`), which is the bitwise complement of 5.

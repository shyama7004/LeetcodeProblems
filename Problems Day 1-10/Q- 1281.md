# 1281. Subtract the Product and Sum of Digits of an Integer


### Given an integer number n, return the difference between the product of its digits and the sum of its digits.
 

 <h3><strong>Example 1:</strong></h3>

> Input: n = 234<br>
Output: 15 <br>
Explanation: <br>
Product of digits = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24 <br>
Sum of digits = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 <br>
Result = 24 - 9 = 15<br>

<h3><strong>Example 2:</strong></h3>

> Input: n = 4421<br>
Output: 21<br>
Explanation: <br>
Product of digits = 4 * 4 * 2 * 1 = 32 <br>
Sum of digits = 4 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 11 <br>
Result = 32 - 11 = 21<br>
 

### Constraints:

`1 <= n <= 10^5`

## Hints :


1. **Digit Extraction:**
   - Use the modulus operator `%` to get the last digit of a number.
   - Use integer division `/` to remove the last digit of a number.

2. **Loop Through Digits:**
   - Use a loop that continues until the number `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Accumulate Results:**
   - Maintain variables to accumulate the sum and product of the digits as you loop through them.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Consider edge cases like `n = 0`, which should return `0 - 0 = 0`.
   - Handle negative numbers if the problem constraints allow them.

## Code :
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int subtractProductAndSum(int n) {
        int sum = 0, product = 1;
        while (n > 0) {
            sum += n % 10;
            product *= n % 10;
            n /= 10;
        }
        return product - sum;
    }
};
```
## Explanation
The problem requires calculating the difference between the product and the sum of the digits of a given integer `n`. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step logic:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `sum` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the sum of the digits.
   - `product` is initialized to 1 to accumulate the product of the digits.

2. **Process Each Digit:**
   - Use a loop to process each digit of the number `n`.
   - In each iteration, extract the last digit using `n % 10`.
   - Add the extracted digit to `sum`.
   - Multiply `product` by the extracted digit.
   - Remove the last digit from `n` using integer division (`n /= 10`).

3. **Calculate the Difference:**
   - After processing all the digits, return the difference between `product` and `sum`.


### Example

For `n = 234`:
- Initial `sum = 0` and `product = 1`.
- Extract digits one by one:
  - Last digit is 4: `sum = 0 + 4 = 4` and `product = 1 * 4 = 4`.
  - Next digit is 3: `sum = 4 + 3 = 7` and `product = 4 * 3 = 12`.
  - Next digit is 2: `sum = 7 + 2 = 9` and `product = 12 * 2 = 24`.
- Final result is `product - sum = 24 - 9 = 15`.

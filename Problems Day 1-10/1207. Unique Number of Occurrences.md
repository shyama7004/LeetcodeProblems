# 1207. Unique Number of Occurrences

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `arr`, return `true` if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique, or `false` otherwise.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:** `arr = [1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3]`  
**Output:** `true`  
**Explanation:** The value `1` has 3 occurrences, `2` has 2, and `3` has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.

### Example 2:

**Input:** `arr = [1, 2]`  
**Output:** `false`

### Example 3:

**Input:** `arr = [-3, 0, 1, -3, 1, 1, 1, -3, 10, 0]`  
**Output:** `true`


## Hints
Here are some hints to help someone solve the problem for the first time using the provided approaches:

### Hint for Approach 1 (Without Sets and Maps)
1. **Think about sorting:** Sorting the array will group identical elements together, which makes it easier to count how many times each element appears.
2. **Focus on counting:** Once you have grouped elements, focus on counting how many times each element appears and store these counts somewhere.
3. **Check for duplicates:** After you have the counts, think about how you can quickly check if any two counts are the same. Sorting the counts can help with this.
4. **Edge cases:** Consider what happens when all elements are the same or when all elements are different.

### Hint for Approach 2 (With Sets and Maps)
1. **Use a map for counting:** Maps (or dictionaries) are great for keeping track of how many times each element appears in the array.
2. **Use a set for uniqueness:** Once you have the counts, think about how a set can help you determine if any of the counts are repeated.
3. **Size comparison:** If the number of unique counts (in the set) matches the number of elements you counted (in the map), then you know all counts are unique.
4. **Think about efficiency:** This approach avoids sorting and instead relies on the fast lookup and insertion operations of maps and sets, which can be more efficient.


## Approach 1: Without Sets and Maps

### Steps:
1. **Sort the Array:** The input array `arr` is sorted to group identical elements together.
2. **Count Occurrences:** Traverse the sorted array, counting the occurrences of each element. Store these counts in a separate vector `v`.
3. **Sort the Counts:** The vector `v` is sorted to make it easier to check for duplicates.
4. **Check for Uniqueness:** Iterate through the vector `v` and check if adjacent elements are equal. If they are, return `false`.
5. **Return True:** If the loop completes, it means all counts are unique, and the function returns `true`.

### Complexity:
- **Time complexity:** `O(n log n)` due to the sorting operations.
- **Space complexity:** `O(n)` to store the count vector `v`.

### Code:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool uniqueOccurrences(vector<int>& arr) {
        // Step 1: Sort the array to group identical elements together
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        vector<int> v;

        // Step 2: Traverse the sorted array and count occurrences of each element
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            int cnt = 1;

            // Count occurrences of the current element
            while (i + 1 < arr.size() && arr[i] == arr[i + 1]) {
                cnt++;
                i++;
            }

            // Store the count in vector v
            v.push_back(cnt);
        }

        // Step 3: Sort the vector v to check for duplicates easily
        sort(v.begin(), v.end());

        // Step 4: Check for adjacent duplicates in the sorted vector
        for (int i = 1; i < v.size(); i++) {
            if (v[i] == v[i - 1]) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        // Step 5: If no duplicates found, return true
        return true;
    }
};
```
The line `v.push_back(cnt);` in the code is used to add the value of `cnt` to the end of the vector `v`.

### Explanation:

- **`v`**: This is a `vector<int>` that is used to store the counts of occurrences of each element in the array.
- **`cnt`**: This variable holds the number of times the current element appears consecutively in the sorted array.

### How It Works:

1. **Counting Occurrences**: As the code iterates through the sorted array, it counts how many times each element appears. This count is stored in the variable `cnt`.
2. **Storing the Count**: After counting the occurrences of an element, the code uses `v.push_back(cnt);` to append (add) this count to the end of the vector `v`.
3. **Result**: By the end of the loop, `v` will contain a list of counts of all elements in the array.

### Example:

If the array is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]`, after sorting and counting, the vector `v` will contain `[1, 2, 3]` because:
- The number `1` occurs `1` time,
- The number `2` occurs `2` times,
- The number `3` occurs `3` times.

### Usage in Context:

The vector `v` is then sorted and checked for duplicates to determine if all the occurrence counts are unique. The `push_back` operation is crucial for building this list of occurrence counts.

### Explanation:
- **Sorting:** By sorting the array, identical elements are grouped together, making it easier to count their occurrences.
- **Counting:** The inner loop counts how many times each element appears consecutively in the sorted array.
- **Checking for Uniqueness:** After storing the counts in vector `v`, sorting the vector allows for a simple comparison of adjacent counts. If any two adjacent counts are equal, the function returns `false` because the occurrences are not unique.

## Approach 2: With Sets and Maps

### Steps:
1. **Count Frequencies:** Create an unordered map `freq` to store the frequency of each element in the array `arr`.
2. **Update Frequencies:** Iterate through each element of the input array `arr` and update the frequency count in the `freq` map.
3. **Store Unique Frequencies:** Create an unordered set `s` to store unique frequencies.
4. **Insert Frequencies:** Iterate through the entries in the `freq` map and insert the frequencies into the set `s`.
5. **Check for Uniqueness:** Compare the size of the `freq` map with the size of the set `s`. If they are equal, it means that the frequencies are unique.

### Complexity:
- **Time complexity:** `O(n)` since we iterate through the array and map entries only once.
- **Space complexity:** `O(n)` due to the storage required for the map and set.

### Code:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool uniqueOccurrences(vector<int>& arr) {
        unordered_map<int, int> freq;

        // Step 1: Count the frequency of each element in the array
        for (auto x : arr) {
            freq[x]++;
        }

        unordered_set<int> s;

        // Step 2: Insert frequencies into the set
        for (auto x : freq) {
            s.insert(x.second);
        }

        // Step 3: Check if all frequencies are unique
        return freq.size() == s.size();
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
- **Using Map and Set:** The unordered map `freq` counts the frequency of each element, and the unordered set `s` is used to check if all frequencies are unique.
- **Efficiency:** This approach is efficient because both the map and set operations (insertion, lookup) are on average `O(1)`, resulting in an overall linear time complexity.
- **Uniqueness Check:** If the number of unique frequencies stored in the set equals the number of elements in the frequency map, then the frequencies are unique.

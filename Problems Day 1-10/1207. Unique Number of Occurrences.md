# 1207. Unique Number of Occurrences

## Problem Statement
- Companies : Amazon, Adobe, Facebook, Apple, Bloomberg

Given an array of integers `arr`, return `true` if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique, or `false` otherwise.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:** `arr = [1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3]`  
**Output:** `true`  
**Explanation:** The value `1` has 3 occurrences, `2` has 2, and `3` has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.

### Example 2:

**Input:** `arr = [1, 2]`  
**Output:** `false`

### Example 3:

**Input:** `arr = [-3, 0, 1, -3, 1, 1, 1, -3, 10, 0]`  
**Output:** `true`

## Constraints

- `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
- `-1000 <= arr[i] <= 1000`


## Hints
Here are some hints to help someone solve the problem for the first time using the provided approaches:

### Hint for Approach 1 (Without Sets and Maps)
1. **Think about sorting:** Sorting the array will group identical elements together, which makes it easier to count how many times each element appears.
2. **Focus on counting:** Once you have grouped elements, focus on counting how many times each element appears and store these counts somewhere.
3. **Check for duplicates:** After you have the counts, think about how you can quickly check if any two counts are the same. Sorting the counts can help with this.
4. **Edge cases:** Consider what happens when all elements are the same or when all elements are different.

### Hint for Approach 2 (With Sets and Maps)
1. **Use a map for counting:** Maps (or dictionaries) are great for keeping track of how many times each element appears in the array.
2. **Use a set for uniqueness:** Once you have the counts, think about how a set can help you determine if any of the counts are repeated.
3. **Size comparison:** If the number of unique counts (in the set) matches the number of elements you counted (in the map), then you know all counts are unique.
4. **Think about efficiency:** This approach avoids sorting and instead relies on the fast lookup and insertion operations of maps and sets, which can be more efficient.


## Approach 1: Without Sets and Maps

### Steps:
1. **Sort the Array:** The input array `arr` is sorted to group identical elements together.
2. **Count Occurrences:** Traverse the sorted array, counting the occurrences of each element. Store these counts in a separate vector `v`.
3. **Sort the Counts:** The vector `v` is sorted to make it easier to check for duplicates.
4. **Check for Uniqueness:** Iterate through the vector `v` and check if adjacent elements are equal. If they are, return `false`.
5. **Return True:** If the loop completes, it means all counts are unique, and the function returns `true`.

### Complexity:
- **Time complexity:** `O(n log n)` due to the sorting operations.
- **Space complexity:** `O(n)` to store the count vector `v`.

### Code:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool uniqueOccurrences(vector<int>& arr) {
        // Step 1: Sort the array to group identical elements together
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        vector<int> v;

        // Step 2: Traverse the sorted array and count occurrences of each element
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            int cnt = 1;

            // Count occurrences of the current element
            while (i + 1 < arr.size() && arr[i] == arr[i + 1]) {
                cnt++;
                i++;
            }

            // Store the count in vector v
            v.push_back(cnt);
        }

        // Step 3: Sort the vector v to check for duplicates easily
        sort(v.begin(), v.end());

        // Step 4: Check for adjacent duplicates in the sorted vector
        for (int i = 1; i < v.size(); i++) {
            if (v[i] == v[i - 1]) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        // Step 5: If no duplicates found, return true
        return true;
    }
};
```
The line `v.push_back(cnt);` in the code is used to add the value of `cnt` to the end of the vector `v`.

### Explanation:

- **`v`**: This is a `vector<int>` that is used to store the counts of occurrences of each element in the array.
- **`cnt`**: This variable holds the number of times the current element appears consecutively in the sorted array.

### How It Works:

1. **Counting Occurrences**: As the code iterates through the sorted array, it counts how many times each element appears. This count is stored in the variable `cnt`.
2. **Storing the Count**: After counting the occurrences of an element, the code uses `v.push_back(cnt);` to append (add) this count to the end of the vector `v`.
3. **Result**: By the end of the loop, `v` will contain a list of counts of all elements in the array.

### Example:

If the array is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]`, after sorting and counting, the vector `v` will contain `[1, 2, 3]` because:
- The number `1` occurs `1` time,
- The number `2` occurs `2` times,
- The number `3` occurs `3` times.

### Usage in Context:

The vector `v` is then sorted and checked for duplicates to determine if all the occurrence counts are unique. The `push_back` operation is crucial for building this list of occurrence counts.

### Explanation:
- **Sorting:** By sorting the array, identical elements are grouped together, making it easier to count their occurrences.
- **Counting:** The inner loop counts how many times each element appears consecutively in the sorted array.
- **Checking for Uniqueness:** After storing the counts in vector `v`, sorting the vector allows for a simple comparison of adjacent counts. If any two adjacent counts are equal, the function returns `false` because the occurrences are not unique.

## Approach 2: With Sets and Maps

### Steps:
1. **Count Frequencies:** Create an unordered map `freq` to store the frequency of each element in the array `arr`.
2. **Update Frequencies:** Iterate through each element of the input array `arr` and update the frequency count in the `freq` map.
3. **Store Unique Frequencies:** Create an unordered set `s` to store unique frequencies.
4. **Insert Frequencies:** Iterate through the entries in the `freq` map and insert the frequencies into the set `s`.
5. **Check for Uniqueness:** Compare the size of the `freq` map with the size of the set `s`. If they are equal, it means that the frequencies are unique.

### Complexity:
- **Time complexity:** `O(n)` since we iterate through the array and map entries only once.
- **Space complexity:** `O(n)` due to the storage required for the map and set.

### Code:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool uniqueOccurrences(vector<int>& arr) {
        unordered_map<int, int> freq;

        // Step 1: Count the frequency of each element in the array
        for (auto x : arr) {
            freq[x]++;
        }

        unordered_set<int> s;

        // Step 2: Insert frequencies into the set
        for (auto x : freq) {
            s.insert(x.second);
        }

        // Step 3: Check if all frequencies are unique
        return freq.size() == s.size();
    }
};
```
Sure! Let's go through the code step by step, explaining each line in detail.

### Code Overview
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool uniqueOccurrences(vector<int>& arr) {
        unordered_map<int, int> freq;

        // Step 1: Count the frequency of each element in the array
        for (auto x : arr) {
            freq[x]++;
        }

        unordered_set<int> s;

        // Step 2: Insert frequencies into the set
        for (auto x : freq) {
            s.insert(x.second);
        }

        // Step 3: Check if all frequencies are unique
        return freq.size() == s.size();
    }
};
```

### Line-by-Line Explanation

1. **`class Solution {`**
   - This line declares a class named `Solution`. In competitive programming, it's common to wrap the solution in a class structure, as many online judges expect this format.

2. **`public:`**
   - This is an access specifier. It means that everything following it will be accessible from outside the class. In this case, the `uniqueOccurrences` function is public, so it can be called from outside the `Solution` class.

3. **`bool uniqueOccurrences(vector<int>& arr) {`**
   - This line defines a function named `uniqueOccurrences` that returns a `bool` value (either `true` or `false`).
   - The function takes a single parameter: a reference to a `vector<int>` named `arr`. This vector holds the array of integers for which we need to determine if all element occurrences are unique.

4. **`unordered_map<int, int> freq;`**
   - This line declares an `unordered_map` named `freq`.
   - The `unordered_map` maps an `int` to another `int`. In this case, the key represents an element from the array, and the value represents the frequency of that element in the array.

5. **`for (auto x : arr) { freq[x]++; }`**
   - This is a range-based `for` loop that iterates over each element `x` in the vector `arr`.
   - `auto x` means that `x` will automatically take the type of elements in `arr`, which are integers (`int`).
   - **What it does**: For each element `x` in `arr`, the loop increments `freq[x]` by 1. This counts how many times `x` appears in `arr`.
     - If `x` is not already in the `freq` map, it is automatically added with an initial value of `0` (because `unordered_map` in C++ initializes new keys to `0`), and then `freq[x]++` increments it to `1`.
     - If `x` is already in `freq`, the current value is incremented by `1`.
   - **Example**: If `arr = {1, 2, 2, 3}`, after this loop:
     - `freq[1] = 1` (since `1` appears once)
     - `freq[2] = 2` (since `2` appears twice)
     - `freq[3] = 1` (since `3` appears once)

6. **`unordered_set<int> s;`**
   - This line declares an `unordered_set` named `s`. 
   - `unordered_set` is a data structure that stores unique elements. In this case, it will store the frequencies of elements from the `freq` map.

7. **`for (auto x : freq) { s.insert(x.second); }`**
   - This is another range-based `for` loop. It iterates over each element `x` in the `freq` map.
   - Since `freq` is a map, `x` is a pair where `x.first` is the key (an element from `arr`) and `x.second` is the value (the frequency of that element).
   - `s.insert(x.second);` inserts the frequency (`x.second`) into the set `s`.
   - **What it does**: This loop adds each unique frequency from `freq` into the set `s`. Since `unordered_set` only stores unique values, if two different elements in `arr` have the same frequency, only one of those frequencies will be stored in `s`.

8. **`return freq.size() == s.size();`**
   - This line returns `true` if the size of the `freq` map is equal to the size of the `s` set; otherwise, it returns `false`.
   - **What it checks**: 
     - `freq.size()` gives the number of unique elements in `arr`.
     - `s.size()` gives the number of unique frequencies in `arr`.
   - If all frequencies are unique, `freq.size()` and `s.size()` will be the same. If there are duplicate frequencies, `s.size()` will be smaller because duplicates are not stored in `unordered_set`.

### Summary of What the Code Does
- The code counts how many times each element appears in the input vector `arr`.
- It then checks if all the counted frequencies are unique.
- The function returns `true` if all frequencies are unique, and `false` if any frequency is repeated.

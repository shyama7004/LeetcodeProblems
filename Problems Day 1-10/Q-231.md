# 231. Power of Two

## Given an integer `n`, return `true` if it is a power of two. Otherwise, `return false`.

An integer `n` is a power of two, if there exists an integer `x` such that `n == 2x`.

 

<h3>Example 1:</h3>

> Input: n = 1<br>
Output: true<br>
Explanation: 20 = 1<br>

<h3>Example 2:</h3>

> Input: n = 16<br>
Output: true<br>
Explanation: 24 = 16<br>

<h3>Example 3:</h3>

> Input: n = 3<br>
Output: false<br>
 

<h4>Constraints:</h4>

`-231 <= n <= 231 - 1`


## Hints
- Modulo(%) function will not work.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) { //Funcion declaration 
        for(int i = 0; i <= 30; i++) {//for loop covers all possible power of 2 that can fit in 32 bit signed integer.
            int ans = pow(2, i);
            if (ans == n) {
                return true;//This method checks if ans = n 
            }
        }
        return false;//If loop completes without finding any power of 2 that equals n, the method returns false.
    }
};
```

This solution is a concise and efficient way to determine if a given integer `n` is a power of two.

### Explanation:

1. **`n > 0`**:
   - This part of the condition ensures that the number `n` is positive. Since powers of two are always positive numbers, this check is necessary. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function will immediately return `false`.

2. **`n & (n - 1)`**:
   - This is a bitwise operation used to determine if `n` is a power of two.
   - **Bitwise AND (`&`)**: The `&` operator compares each bit of `n` and `n - 1`. It returns `1` if both corresponding bits are `1`, and `0` otherwise.
   - **How It Works**:
     - A power of two in binary form always has exactly one `1` bit followed by `0` bits (e.g., `2` is `10`, `4` is `100`, `8` is `1000`, etc.).
     - Subtracting `1` from a power of two flips all bits after the single `1` to `1` and the `1` itself to `0`. For example:
       - `4` (which is `100` in binary) becomes `3` (which is `011` in binary).
     - Therefore, when you perform the bitwise AND operation between `n` and `n - 1`, the result will be `0` if `n` is a power of two because there are no common `1` bits between `n` and `n - 1`.
     - If `n` is not a power of two, `n & (n - 1)` will yield a non-zero result because `n` has more than one `1` bit, and at least one will remain after subtracting `1`.

3. **`not (n & (n - 1))`**:
   - The `not` keyword (which is equivalent to `!` in C++) is a logical NOT operator. It negates the result of the expression `n & (n - 1)`.
   - If `n & (n - 1)` is `0` (meaning `n` is a power of two), `not 0` will evaluate to `true`.
   - If `n & (n - 1)` is not `0` (meaning `n` is not a power of two), `not` will convert it to `false`.

### Example:

- For `n = 4`:
  - `n > 0`: `4 > 0` is `true`.
  - `n & (n - 1)`: `4 & 3` is `100 & 011`, which equals `000`, so `not 0` is `true`.
  - The function returns `true`.

- For `n = 5`:
  - `n > 0`: `5 > 0` is `true`.
  - `n & (n - 1)`: `5 & 4` is `101 & 100`, which equals `100`, so `not 100` is `false`.
  - The function returns `false`.

This code efficiently determines if `n` is a power of two in constant time, `O(1)`, with minimal computational overhead.

# 70. Climbing Stairs

## Problem Statement

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `n = 2`  
**Output:** `2`  
**Explanation:** There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

### Example 2

**Input:** `n = 3`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:** There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 45`

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        if(n == 0) return 0;
        if(n == 1) return 1;

        int a = 1 ,b = 2;
        for(int i = 3;i<=n;++i)
        {
            int next = a+b;
            a = b;
            b = next;
        }
        return b;
    }
};
```

## Explanation

```cpp
        if(n == 0) return 0;
        if(n == 1) return 1;
```
- **Explanation**: These are base cases for the staircase problem:
  - If `n` is `0`, there are `0` ways to climb the stairs, so the function returns `0`.
  - If `n` is `1`, there is only `1` way to climb the stairs, so the function returns `1`.

```cpp
        int a = 1, b = 2;
```
- **Explanation**: Two integers, `a` and `b`, are initialized. 
  - `a` represents the number of ways to climb `1` stair (which is 1).
  - `b` represents the number of ways to climb `2` stairs (which is 2). 
  These variables will be used to store the number of ways to climb the last two levels of stairs as we compute the next one.

```cpp
        for(int i = 3; i <= n; ++i)
        {
```
- **Explanation**: A `for` loop starts from `i = 3` and runs until `i` is equal to `n`. This loop will be used to calculate the number of distinct ways to climb from `3` stairs up to `n` stairs.

```cpp
            int next = a + b;
```
- **Explanation**: Inside the loop, `next` is calculated as the sum of `a` and `b`. This represents the number of ways to climb `i` stairs:
  - You can either take a single step from `i-1` (which has `b` ways), or
  - You can take a double step from `i-2` (which has `a` ways).
  
  Therefore, the number of ways to climb `i` stairs is `a + b`.

```cpp
            a = b;
            b = next;
```
- **Explanation**: After computing the number of ways to climb `i` stairs, the values of `a` and `b` are updated:
  - `a` takes the value of `b` (the number of ways to climb `i-1` stairs).
  - `b` takes the value of `next` (the number of ways to climb `i` stairs).

  This step effectively shifts the window of the last two computed values forward.

```cpp
        }
```
- **Explanation**: The loop ends here. After the loop finishes, `b` will hold the value representing the number of ways to climb `n` stairs.

```cpp
        return b;
```
- **Explanation**: The function returns `b`, which now contains the number of distinct ways to climb `n` stairs.

```cpp
    }
};
```
- **Explanation**: The class and function definitions end here.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this function is **O(n)** because the loop runs `n-2` times (for `i` from 3 to `n`), which simplifies to `O(n)`.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity of this function is **O(1)**. The function uses a constant amount of space regardless of the input size, as it only uses a few integer variables (`a`, `b`, `next`).

### Summary

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

## Top voted solution
### Intuition
To calculate the number of ways to climb `n` stairs, observe that each step can be reached either from the previous step `(n-1)` or from two steps below `(n-2)`. This leads to a solution based on the Fibonacci sequence.

### Approach 1: Recursion
- **Explanation**: Uses a recursive Fibonacci approach but has exponential time complexity \(O(2^n)\) due to redundant calculations.
- **Code**:
  ```cpp
  class Solution {
  public:
      int climbStairs(int n) {
          if (n == 0 || n == 1) return 1;
          return climbStairs(n-1) + climbStairs(n-2);
      }
  };
  ```

### Approach 2: Memoization
- **Explanation**: Improves recursion by storing intermediate results in a map to avoid redundant calculations.
- **Code**:
  ```cpp
  class Solution {
  public:
      int climbStairs(int n, unordered_map<int, int>& memo) {
          if (n == 0 || n == 1) return 1;
          if (memo.find(n) == memo.end()) {
              memo[n] = climbStairs(n-1, memo) + climbStairs(n-2, memo);
          }
          return memo[n];
      }
      int climbStairs(int n) {
          unordered_map<int, int> memo;
          return climbStairs(n, memo);
      }
  };
  ```

### Approach 3: Tabulation
- **Explanation**: Uses a bottom-up approach with a DP table to iteratively calculate the number of ways.
- **Code**:
  ```cpp
  class Solution {
  public:
      int climbStairs(int n) {
          if (n == 0 || n == 1) return 1;
          vector<int> dp(n+1);
          dp[0] = dp[1] = 1;
          for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
              dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
          }
          return dp[n];
      }
  };
  ```

## Approach 4: Space Optimization
- **Explanation**: Reduces space complexity by using only two variables instead of a DP table.
- **Code**:
  ```cpp
  class Solution {
  public:
      int climbStairs(int n) {
          if (n == 0 || n == 1) return 1;
          int prev = 1, curr = 1;
          for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
              int temp = curr;
              curr = prev + curr;
              prev = temp;
          }
          return curr;
      }
  };
  ```

# 53. Maximum Subarray

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.

## Example 1

- **Input:** `nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]`
- **Output:** `6`
- **Explanation:** The subarray `[4,-1,2,1]` has the largest sum `6`.

## Example 2

- **Input:** `nums = [1]`
- **Output:** `1`
- **Explanation:** The subarray `[1]` has the largest sum `1`.

## Example 3

- **Input:** `nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]`
- **Output:** `23`
- **Explanation:** The subarray `[5,4,-1,7,8]` has the largest sum `23`.

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

## Follow-Up

If you have figured out the `O(n)` solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.


# Intuition

The intuition behind the code is to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within the given array `nums`. It does this by scanning through the array and keeping track of the current sum of the subarray. Whenever the current sum becomes greater than the maximum sum encountered so far, it updates the maximum sum. If the current sum becomes negative, it resets the sum to 0 and starts a new subarray. By the end of the loop, the code returns the maximum sum found.

# Approach

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - We start by initializing two variables: `maxSum` and `currentSum`.
   - `maxSum` represents the maximum sum encountered so far and is initially set to the minimum possible integer value to ensure that any valid subarray sum will be greater than it.
   - `currentSum` represents the current sum of the subarray being considered and is initially set to 0.

2. **Iterate Through the Array:**
   - We iterate through the `nums` array using a `for` loop, starting from the first element and going up to the last element.
   - For each element in the array, we add it to the current sum `currentSum`. This calculates the sum of the subarray ending at the current element.

3. **Update maxSum:**
   - Next, we check if the current sum `currentSum` is greater than the current maximum sum `maxSum`.
   - If it is, we update `maxSum` with the new value of `currentSum`. This means we have found a new maximum subarray sum.

4. **Reset Current Sum:**
   - If the current sum `currentSum` becomes negative, it indicates that including the current element in the subarray would reduce the overall sum. In such cases, we reset `currentSum` to 0. This effectively discards the current subarray and allows us to start a fresh subarray from the next element.

5. **Repeat:**
   - We repeat steps 2 to 4 for each element in the array.

6. **Return the Result:**
   - After iterating through the entire array, the variable `maxSum` will contain the maximum subarray sum encountered.
   - Finally, we return the value of `maxSum` as the result, representing the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within the given array `nums`.

# Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int maxSum = INT_MIN;
        int currentSum = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            currentSum += nums[i];
            
            if (currentSum > maxSum) {
                maxSum = currentSum;
            }
            
            if (currentSum < 0) {
                currentSum = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return maxSum;
    }
};

```
### My nala code
```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_map<int, int> subarraySums; // Stores max subarray sum ending at each index
        int maxSum = INT_MIN;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            // Calculate current subarray sum ending at index i
            if (i == 0) {
                subarraySums[i] = nums[i]; // The first element is its own subarray
            } else {
                // Either extend the previous subarray or start a new subarray at index i
                subarraySums[i] = max(nums[i], nums[i] + subarraySums[i - 1]);
            }
            
            // Update the overall max sum
            maxSum = max(maxSum, subarraySums[i]);
        }
        
        return maxSum;
    }
};
```
### Key Points:
1. **Why Use `unordered_map`?**
   - In this example, the map `subarraySums` stores the maximum subarray sum ending at each index `i`. However, this is not necessary for solving the problem using Kadane's algorithm. Storing these sums is redundant and increases both time and space complexity.

2. **Why the Original Code Is Better:**
   - The original code is more efficient because it only uses constant space (`O(1)`), whereas using an `unordered_map` introduces additional overhead both in time (due to hash operations) and space (`O(n)`).

3. **Performance Impact:**
   - The original algorithm runs in \(O(n)\) time and uses \(O(1)\) space. Introducing an `unordered_map` would still have \(O(n)\) time complexity but increase space complexity to \(O(n)\) with unnecessary overhead.

### Conclusion:
Using `unordered_map` in this scenario is not beneficial and would make the solution less efficient. Kadane's algorithm is optimal for this problem and should be used as is without introducing an `unordered_map`.

# 240. Search a 2D Matrix II

## Problem Statement

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value `target` in an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix`. This matrix has the following properties:

- Integers in each row are sorted in ascending order from left to right.
- Integers in each column are sorted in ascending order from top to bottom.

## Example 1

**Input:**
``` 
matrix = [[1,  4,  7, 11, 15],
          [2,  5,  8, 12, 19],
          [3,  6,  9, 16, 22],
          [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
          [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]], 
target = 5
```

**Output:**
```
true
```

## Example 2

**Input:**
``` 
matrix = [[1,  4,  7, 11, 15],
          [2,  5,  8, 12, 19],
          [3,  6,  9, 16, 22],
          [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
          [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]], 
target = 20
```

**Output:**
```
false
```

## Constraints

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= n, m <= 300`
- `-10^9 <= matrix[i][j] <= 10^9`
- All integers in each row are sorted in ascending order.
- All integers in each column are sorted in ascending order.
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`

### Observation and Logic

When approaching the problem of searching for a target value in a sorted 2D matrix where each row and column is sorted, my initial thoughts would be to leverage the sorted nature of the matrix for an efficient search. Starting from the top-right corner allows us to make decisions based on comparisons with the target, either moving downward or leftward iteratively until the target is found or all possibilities are exhausted.

#### Approach

1. Start from the top-right corner of the matrix.
2. If the current cell equals the target, return `true`.
3. If the current cell is less than the target, move downward to explore larger elements.
4. If the current cell is greater than the target, shift left to explore smaller elements in the same row.
5. Iteratively adjust the search based on comparisons until the target is found or all possibilities are exhausted.
6. If the target is not found after exploring all cells, return `false`.

#### Example Explanation

Consider a 2D matrix where each row and each column is sorted in ascending order:

```cpp
// Example matrix
vector<vector<int>> matrix = {
    {1, 4, 7, 11},
    {2, 5, 8, 12},
    {3, 6, 9, 16},
    {10, 13, 14, 17}
};
```

1. We start at the top-right corner of the matrix (`rowIndex = 0`, `colIndex = 3`).
2. Compare `matrix[0][3]` (value `11`) with the target value (let's say `target = 6`). Since `11 > 6`, move leftward (`colIndex--`).
3. Now compare `matrix[0][2]` (value `7`) with `target = 6`. Since `7 > 6`, move leftward again (`colIndex--`).
4. Now compare `matrix[0][1]` (value `4`) with `target = 6`. Since `4 < 6`, move downward (`rowIndex++`).
5. Now compare `matrix[1][1]` (value `5`) with `target = 6`. Since `5 < 6`, move downward again (`rowIndex++`).
6. Now compare `matrix[2][1]` (value `6`) with `target = 6`. Since `6 == 6`, we found the target! Return `true`.

## My nala Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool searchMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int target) {
        int col = matrix.size();
        int row = matrix[0].size();

        int rowIndex = 0;
        int colIndex = col - 1;

        while( rowIndex <= row && colIndex <= col)
        {
            int element = matrix[rowIndex][colIndex];

            if(element == target)
            {
                return 1;
            }
            if(element < target)
            {
                rowIndex++;
            }
            else
            {
                colIndex--;
            }
        }
        return 0;
        
    }
};
```

### Identifying Issues

1. **Incorrect size assignments for row and column**:
   - `int col = matrix.size();` should be `int row = matrix.size();`
   - `int row = matrix[0].size();` should be `int col = matrix[0].size();`

2. **Incorrect boundary check in the while loop**:
   - The condition `rowIndex <= row` should be `rowIndex < row` because array indexing starts from 0 and goes up to `row - 1`.

3. **Returning `1` and `0`**:
   - Use `true` and `false` for returning boolean values.

### Corrected Code

Here is the corrected version of your `Solution` class:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool searchMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int target) {
        if (matrix.empty() || matrix[0].empty()) {
            return false;
        }

        int row = matrix.size();
        int col = matrix[0].size();
        
        int rowIndex = 0;
        int colIndex = col - 1;

        while (rowIndex < row && colIndex >= 0) {
            int element = matrix[rowIndex][colIndex];

            if (element == target) {
                return true;
            }
            if (element < target) {
                rowIndex++;
            } else {
                colIndex--;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   int row = matrix.size();
   int col = matrix[0].size();
   ```
   - These correctly assign the number of rows and columns in the matrix.

2. **Boundary Check in the While Loop**:
   ```cpp
   while (rowIndex < row && colIndex >= 0)
   ```
   - This ensures that `rowIndex` is within the valid range `[0, row-1]` and `colIndex` is within `[0, col-1]`.

3. **Element Comparison**:
   ```cpp
   int element = matrix[rowIndex][colIndex];

   if (element == target) {
       return true;
   }
   if (element < target) {
       rowIndex++;
   } else {
       colIndex--;
   }
   ```
   - If the current element is equal to the target, return `true`.
   - If the current element is less than the target, move down to the next row.
   - If the current element is greater than the target, move left to the previous column.

4. **Return Statement**:
   ```cpp
   return false;
   ```
   - If the target is not found in the matrix, return `false`.

### Example Usage

To test the `searchMatrix` function, you can use the following example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<vector<int>> matrix = {
        {1, 3, 5, 7},
        {10, 11, 16, 20},
        {23, 30, 34, 60}
    };
    int target = 3;

    bool result = solution.searchMatrix(matrix, target);
    cout << (result ? "Found" : "Not Found") << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Output

```
Found
```

This will correctly output "Found" if the target is in the matrix and "Not Found" otherwise.


### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the algorithm can be analyzed by examining how many steps it takes to find the target element in the matrix. Hereâ€™s the breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initializing pointers `rowIndex` and `colIndex` is a constant-time operation, \(O(1)\).

2. **While Loop**:
   - The while loop continues as long as `rowIndex` is less than the number of rows (`row`) and `colIndex` is non-negative.
   - In each iteration, we either move one row down (`rowIndex++`) or one column left (`colIndex--`).

Since we start at the top-right corner of the matrix and each step moves either down or left:
- In the worst case, we could move down `row` times (maximum number of rows).
- We could also move left `col` times (maximum number of columns).

Thus, in the worst case, we perform a total of \(row + col\) steps.

Given a matrix with dimensions `m x n`:
- `row = m`
- `col = n`

Therefore, the time complexity of the algorithm is \(O(m + n)\).

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of the algorithm can be analyzed by looking at the additional memory used by the algorithm:

1. **Input Matrix**:
   - The input matrix itself occupies \(O(m \cdot n)\) space, but this is not considered in the space complexity since it's part of the input.

2. **Auxiliary Space**:
   - The algorithm uses a fixed amount of extra space:
     - Two integer variables (`rowIndex` and `colIndex`) for iterating through the matrix.
     - One integer variable (`element`) to hold the current element being compared.
   - These variables take \(O(1)\) space, i.e., constant space.

Thus, the auxiliary space complexity of the algorithm is \(O(1)\).

### Summary

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(m + n)\)
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)

This makes the algorithm efficient in terms of both time and space, leveraging the sorted properties of the matrix rows and columns to quickly zero in on the target element.

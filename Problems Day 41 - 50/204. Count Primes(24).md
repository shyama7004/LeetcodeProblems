# 204. Count Primes

Given an integer `n`, return the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than `n`.

## Example 1:
**Input:** `n = 10`  
**Output:** `4`  
**Explanation:** There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 7.

## Example 2:
**Input:** `n = 0`  
**Output:** `0`

## Example 3:
**Input:** `n = 1`  
**Output:** `0`

## Constraints:
`0 <= n <= 5 * 10^6`

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    bool isPrime(int n)
    {
        if(n <= 1)
        {
            return false;
        }

        for(int i = 2; i < n; i++)
        {
            if(n % i == 0)
            {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
public:
    int countPrimes(int n) {
        
        int count = 0;

        for(int i = 2; i < n; i++)
        {
            if(isPrime(i))
            {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```
- The problem with the code is that it exceeds modern computational limits, as contemporary computers can handle up to \(10^8\) computations efficiently.
- Therefore, we use `Sieve of Eratosthenes`

we have jotted every value from 1 to 40.

Let's take `n = 40` as an example. Excluding 1 and 40 itself, we follow these steps:

1. Assume every number is prime initially.
2. Start with number 2 and mark every multiple of 2 as non-prime.
3. Move to number 3 and mark every multiple of 3 as non-prime.
4. Continue with number 5 and mark every multiple of 5 as non-prime.
5. Proceed with number 7 and mark every multiple of 7 as non-prime.
6. For number 11, mark every multiple of 11 as non-prime.
7. For number 13, mark every multiple of 13 as non-prime.
8. For number 17, mark every multiple of 17 as non-prime.
9. For number 19, mark every multiple of 19 as non-prime.
10. Number 23 is out of scope for marking as its multiples are beyond 40.
11. Similarly, number 29 is out of scope.
12. Number 31 is also out of scope.
13. Finally, number 37 is out of scope as well.

By following these steps, we effectively mark all non-prime numbers, leaving only the primes.

## Code 
```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int countPrimes(int n) {
        int count = 0;

        vector<bool> prime(n + 1, true);

        prime[0] = prime[1] = false;

        for(int i = 2; i < n; i++)
        {
            if(prime[i])
            {
                count++;

                for(int j = 2 * i; j < n; j = j + i)
                {
                    prime[j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
    return count;
        
    }
};

### Sum of a Harmonic Progression

The sum of the first <i>n</i> terms of a harmonic progression (HP) can be understood by first knowing that in an HP, the reciprocals of the terms form an arithmetic progression (AP).

Given a harmonic progression \(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n\), the reciprocals \(1/a_1, 1/a_2, 1/a_3, \ldots, 1/a_n\) form an arithmetic progression. Let the first term of this AP be \(b\) and the common difference be \(d\). Therefore, the <i>i</i>-th term of the HP can be written as:

\[a_i = 1/(b + (i - 1)d)\]

The sum of the first <i>n</i> terms of this HP is:

\[S_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \ldots + a_n\]

\[S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 1/(b + (i - 1)d)\]

This is the sum of the reciprocals of an arithmetic progression, which does not have a simple closed-form formula like an arithmetic or geometric series. However, it can be approximated or computed numerically.

### Example Calculation

Suppose we want to find the sum of the first 5 terms of a harmonic progression where the reciprocals form an AP with the first term \(b = 1\) and common difference \(d = 1\).

\[S_5 = 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5\]

\[S_5 = 1 + 0.5 + 0.3333 + 0.25 + 0.2\]

\[S_5 \approx 2.2833\]

### General Approach

For a general approach to sum the first <i>n</i> terms of a harmonic progression:

1. Identify the corresponding AP sequence: the reciprocals of the HP terms.
2. Sum the reciprocals of this AP up to the <i>n</i>-th term.

### Formula and Approximation

While there is no simple formula for the exact sum, the sum of the first <i>n</i> terms of a harmonic series (where \(d = 1\) and \(b = 1\)) is approximately given by:

\[H_n = \ln(n) + \gamma\]

where \(\gamma\) is the Euler-Mascheroni constant (approximately 0.577).

For more complex HPs, numerical methods or specialized software might be used to compute the sum.



The segmented sieve algorithm is an efficient method for finding all prime numbers in a given range \([L, R]\). This method is particularly useful when \(R\) is large and \(L\) is not too small, as it reduces the memory usage compared to the standard sieve of Eratosthenes. Here’s what you should know about the segmented sieve and how to implement it in C++.

### Key Concepts of Segmented Sieve

1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: First, use the sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers up to \(\sqrt{R}\). These primes are used to mark non-prime numbers in the range \([L, R]\).

2. **Segmenting the Range**: The range \([L, R]\) is divided into smaller segments that are processed individually.

3. **Marking Non-Primes**: For each prime found in the initial sieve, mark its multiples in the range \([L, R]\).

### Steps to Implement Segmented Sieve

1. **Compute Primes up to \(\sqrt{R}\)**:
   - Use the sieve of Eratosthenes to find all primes up to \(\sqrt{R}\).

2. **Initialize the Segment**:
   - Create an array to represent the range \([L, R]\) and initialize all elements to true (assuming all numbers in the range are prime).

3. **Mark Non-Primes in the Segment**:
   - For each prime \(p\) (from the primes up to \(\sqrt{R}\)), find the first multiple of \(p\) within \([L, R]\) and mark all multiples of \(p\) as non-prime.

### C++ Implementation

Here’s a C++ implementation of the segmented sieve algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

// Function to perform the sieve of Eratosthenes
void simpleSieve(int limit, vector<int>& primes) {
    vector<bool> isPrime(limit + 1, true);
    for (int p = 2; p * p <= limit; ++p) {
        if (isPrime[p]) {
            for (int i = p * p; i <= limit; i += p) {
                isPrime[i] = false;
            }
        }
    }
    for (int p = 2; p <= limit; ++p) {
        if (isPrime[p]) {
            primes.push_back(p);
        }
    }
}

// Function to find primes in the range [L, R] using the segmented sieve algorithm
void segmentedSieve(long long L, long long R) {
    int limit = sqrt(R);
    vector<int> primes;
    simpleSieve(limit, primes);

    vector<bool> isPrime(R - L + 1, true);

    // Mark non-primes in range [L, R] using the primes found in the simple sieve
    for (int i = 0; i < primes.size(); ++i) {
        int currentPrime = primes[i];
        long long base = (L / currentPrime) * currentPrime;
        if (base < L) base += currentPrime;

        for (long long j = base; j <= R; j += currentPrime) {
            if (j != currentPrime) { // Exclude the prime number itself
                isPrime[j - L] = false;
            }
        }
    }

    // Print the primes in the range [L, R]
    for (long long i = L; i <= R; ++i) {
        if (isPrime[i - L] && i != 1) { // Exclude 1 as it is not a prime number
            cout << i << " ";
        }
    }
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    long long L = 10, R = 50;
    cout << "Primes in range [" << L << ", " << R << "] are: ";
    segmentedSieve(L, R);
    return 0;
}
```
Sure, let’s go through the `segmentedSieve` function step by step:

### Purpose:
The purpose of the `segmentedSieve` function is to find all prime numbers in a given range `[L, R]` using a more efficient approach than checking each number individually. This is particularly useful for large ranges.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Calculate the Square Root of R**:
   ```cpp
   int limit = sqrt(R);
   ```
   - We calculate the square root of `R`. This will be the upper limit for the simple sieve to find small primes up to `sqrt(R)`.

2. **Find All Primes up to `sqrt(R)`**:
   ```cpp
   vector<int> primes;
   simpleSieve(limit, primes);
   ```
   - We use a simple sieve of Eratosthenes (`simpleSieve`) to find all prime numbers up to `sqrt(R)`. These primes are stored in the `primes` vector. These small primes will be used to mark non-prime numbers in the range `[L, R]`.

3. **Initialize the Range [L, R] as Prime**:
   ```cpp
   vector<bool> isPrime(R - L + 1, true);
   ```
   - We create a boolean vector `isPrime` of size `R - L + 1` and initialize all entries to `true`. This vector will help us mark non-prime numbers within the range `[L, R]`.

4. **Mark Non-Primes in the Range [L, R]**:
   ```cpp
   for (int i = 0; i < primes.size(); ++i) {
       int currentPrime = primes[i];
       long long base = (L / currentPrime) * currentPrime;
       if (base < L) base += currentPrime;

       for (long long j = base; j <= R; j += currentPrime) {
           if (j != currentPrime) {
               isPrime[j - L] = false;
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   - For each prime found in step 2 (`currentPrime`), we mark its multiples as non-prime in the range `[L, R]`.
   - We calculate the first multiple of `currentPrime` within the range `[L, R]`:
     ```cpp
     long long base = (L / currentPrime) * currentPrime;
     if (base < L) base += currentPrime;
     ```
     This ensures that `base` is the smallest multiple of `currentPrime` that is greater than or equal to `L`.
   - We then mark all multiples of `currentPrime` as non-prime in the range `[L, R]`:
     ```cpp
     for (long long j = base; j <= R; j += currentPrime) {
         if (j != currentPrime) { // Exclude the prime number itself
             isPrime[j - L] = false;
         }
     }
     ```
     The condition `if (j != currentPrime)` ensures that we do not mark the prime number itself as non-prime.

5. **Print the Primes in the Range [L, R]**:
   ```cpp
   for (long long i = L; i <= R; ++i) {
       if (isPrime[i - L] && i != 1) { // Exclude 1 as it is not a prime number
           cout << i << " ";
       }
   }
   cout << endl;
   ```
   - Finally, we iterate through the range `[L, R]` and print the numbers that remain marked as prime in the `isPrime` vector. We also ensure to exclude 1, as it is not a prime number.

### Summary:
The `segmentedSieve` function efficiently finds all prime numbers in a given range `[L, R]` by leveraging a smaller simple sieve to find small primes up to `sqrt(R)`. These small primes are then used to mark non-prime numbers within the specified range, resulting in a more efficient algorithm suitable for large ranges.

# 204. Count Primes

Given an integer `n`, return the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than `n`.

## Example 1:
**Input:** `n = 10`  
**Output:** `4`  
**Explanation:** There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 7.

## Example 2:
**Input:** `n = 0`  
**Output:** `0`

## Example 3:
**Input:** `n = 1`  
**Output:** `0`

## Constraints:
`0 <= n <= 5 * 10^6`

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    bool isPrime(int n)
    {
        if(n <= 1)
        {
            return false;
        }

        for(int i = 2; i < n; i++)
        {
            if(n % i == 0)
            {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
public:
    int countPrimes(int n) {
        
        int count = 0;

        for(int i = 2; i < n; i++)
        {
            if(isPrime(i))
            {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```
- The problem with the code is that it exceeds modern computational limits, as contemporary computers can handle up to \(10^8\) computations efficiently.
- Therefore, we use `Sieve of Eratosthenes`

we have jotted every value from 1 to 40.

Let's take `n = 40` as an example. Excluding 1 and 40 itself, we follow these steps:

1. Assume every number is prime initially.
2. Start with number 2 and mark every multiple of 2 as non-prime.
3. Move to number 3 and mark every multiple of 3 as non-prime.
4. Continue with number 5 and mark every multiple of 5 as non-prime.
5. Proceed with number 7 and mark every multiple of 7 as non-prime.
6. For number 11, mark every multiple of 11 as non-prime.
7. For number 13, mark every multiple of 13 as non-prime.
8. For number 17, mark every multiple of 17 as non-prime.
9. For number 19, mark every multiple of 19 as non-prime.
10. Number 23 is out of scope for marking as its multiples are beyond 40.
11. Similarly, number 29 is out of scope.
12. Number 31 is also out of scope.
13. Finally, number 37 is out of scope as well.

By following these steps, we effectively mark all non-prime numbers, leaving only the primes.

## Code 
```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int countPrimes(int n) {
        int count = 0;

        vector<bool> prime(n + 1, true);

        prime[0] = prime[1] = false;

        for(int i = 2; i < n; i++)
        {
            if(prime[i])
            {
                count++;

                for(int j = 2 * i; j < n; j = j + i)
                {
                    prime[j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
    return count;
        
    }
};

### Sum of a Harmonic Progression

The sum of the first <i>n</i> terms of a harmonic progression (HP) can be understood by first knowing that in an HP, the reciprocals of the terms form an arithmetic progression (AP).

Given a harmonic progression \(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n\), the reciprocals \(1/a_1, 1/a_2, 1/a_3, \ldots, 1/a_n\) form an arithmetic progression. Let the first term of this AP be \(b\) and the common difference be \(d\). Therefore, the <i>i</i>-th term of the HP can be written as:

\[a_i = 1/(b + (i - 1)d)\]

The sum of the first <i>n</i> terms of this HP is:

\[S_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \ldots + a_n\]

\[S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 1/(b + (i - 1)d)\]

This is the sum of the reciprocals of an arithmetic progression, which does not have a simple closed-form formula like an arithmetic or geometric series. However, it can be approximated or computed numerically.

### Example Calculation

Suppose we want to find the sum of the first 5 terms of a harmonic progression where the reciprocals form an AP with the first term \(b = 1\) and common difference \(d = 1\).

\[S_5 = 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5\]

\[S_5 = 1 + 0.5 + 0.3333 + 0.25 + 0.2\]

\[S_5 \approx 2.2833\]

### General Approach

For a general approach to sum the first <i>n</i> terms of a harmonic progression:

1. Identify the corresponding AP sequence: the reciprocals of the HP terms.
2. Sum the reciprocals of this AP up to the <i>n</i>-th term.

### Formula and Approximation

While there is no simple formula for the exact sum, the sum of the first <i>n</i> terms of a harmonic series (where \(d = 1\) and \(b = 1\)) is approximately given by:

\[H_n = \ln(n) + \gamma\]

where \(\gamma\) is the Euler-Mascheroni constant (approximately 0.577).

For more complex HPs, numerical methods or specialized software might be used to compute the sum.

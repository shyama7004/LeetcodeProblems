# 1095. Find in Mountain Array

## Problem Statement

(This problem is an interactive problem.)

You may recall that an array `arr` is a mountain array if and only if:

- `arr.length >= 3`
- There exists some `i` with `0 < i < arr.length - 1` such that:
  - `arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]`
  - `arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`

Given a mountain array `mountainArr`, return the minimum index such that `mountainArr.get(index) == target`. If such an index does not exist, return `-1`.

You cannot access the mountain array directly. You may only access the array using a `MountainArray` interface:

- `MountainArray.get(k)` returns the element of the array at index `k` (0-indexed).
- `MountainArray.length()` returns the length of the array.

Submissions making more than 100 calls to `MountainArray.get` will be judged as **Wrong Answer**. Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:** `array = [1,2,3,4,5,3,1]`, `target = 3`

**Output:** `2`

**Explanation:** `3` exists in the array at index `2` and index `5`. Return the minimum index, which is `2`.

### Example 2:

**Input:** `array = [0,1,2,4,2,1]`, `target = 3`

**Output:** `-1`

**Explanation:** `3` does not exist in the array, so we return `-1`.

## Code(I was only able to find the peak)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findInMountainArray(int target, MountainArray &mountainArr) {
        int s = 0;
        int e = mountainArr.length() - 1;

        // First, find the peak element
        while (s < e) {
            int mid = s + (e - s) / 2;
            if (mountainArr.get(mid) < mountainArr.get(mid + 1)) {
                s = mid + 1;
            } else {
                e = mid;
            }
        }

        // s (or e) now points to the peak index
        int peak = s;

        // Binary search on the increasing part of the array
        s = 0;
        e = peak;
        while (s <= e) {
            int mid = s + (e - s) / 2;
            int midVal = mountainArr.get(mid);
            if (midVal == target) {
                return mid;
            } else if (midVal < target) {
                s = mid + 1;
            } else {
                e = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        // Binary search on the decreasing part of the array
        s = peak + 1;
        e = mountainArr.length() - 1;
        while (s <= e) {
            int mid = s + (e - s) / 2;
            int midVal = mountainArr.get(mid);
            if (midVal == target) {
                return mid;
            } else if (midVal > target) {
                s = mid + 1;
            } else {
                e = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        // If the target was not found in either part
        return -1;
    }
};
```

The distinction between using `s <= e` and `s < e` in a binary search is subtle but important. Let's break it down:

### 1. **Using `s < e`:**
   - When you use `s < e`, the loop continues as long as `s` is strictly less than `e`.
   - This means that when `s` equals `e`, the loop terminates, and the last possible comparison is not made.

### 2. **Using `s <= e`:**
   - When you use `s <= e`, the loop continues until `s` is greater than `e`.
   - This allows the loop to consider the scenario where `s` equals `e`, making sure that every element, including the last possible element, is checked.

### Why `s <= e` in Binary Search:
- **Guaranteeing the Check of Every Possible Index:** 
  - Using `s <= e` ensures that every possible index in the search range is considered, including when `s` and `e` point to the same index. This is crucial for binary search because you want to check every potential location where the target might be.

### Example to Illustrate:

Suppose you have the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and you are searching for the number `5`:

- **Initial values:** `s = 0`, `e = 4`
- **First iteration:**
  - `mid = (0 + 4) / 2 = 2` (index 2, value `3`)
  - Since `3 < 5`, you set `s = mid + 1 = 3`
- **Second iteration:**
  - `mid = (3 + 4) / 2 = 3` (index 3, value `4`)
  - Since `4 < 5`, you set `s = mid + 1 = 4`
- **Third iteration:**
  - Now `s = 4` and `e = 4`, so `mid = (4 + 4) / 2 = 4` (index 4, value `5`)
  - This is the correct index where `5` is found.

If you had used `s < e`, the loop would have terminated before the third iteration, and you would not have checked the last element at index 4.

### **In the Context of Your Code:**
- **Left Side Search (`s <= e`)**: Ensures that you find the target even if it's located at the exact boundary or the last possible index of the search range.
- **Right Side Search (`s <= e`)**: Similarly, it ensures you check every possible position in the range, particularly important in the context of the binary search in a mountain array.

### **Conclusion:**
Using `s <= e` instead of `s < e` in binary search is necessary to ensure that every element in the search range is considered, which is crucial for the correctness of the algorithm, especially when the target might be at the boundary or the last element.

### 1. **Binary Search in the Increasing Part (Left Side of the Peak):**
   - **Why?** The part of the array from the beginning (`index 0`) to the peak is strictly increasing. This means that if the target exists in this part, it must appear before or at the peak.
   - **How?**
     - Start by initializing `s = 0` and `e = peak`.
     - Perform a standard binary search:
       - Calculate `mid` as the middle point between `s` and `e`.
       - Check if `mountainArr.get(mid)` equals the target.
         - If it does, return `mid` because you've found the target at the smallest possible index.
       - If `mountainArr.get(mid)` is less than the target, move the search to the right (`s = mid + 1`).
       - If `mountainArr.get(mid)` is greater than the target, move the search to the left (`e = mid - 1`).

   - **Result:** If the target is found in this increasing part, the function returns its index. If not, the search continues in the next part.

### 2. **Binary Search in the Decreasing Part (Right Side of the Peak):**
   - **Why?** The part of the array from the peak to the end (`index n-1`) is strictly decreasing. If the target wasn't found in the increasing part, it might be in this decreasing part.
   - **How?**
     - Now, start the search from just after the peak: `s = peak + 1` and `e = mountainArr.length() - 1`.
     - Perform another binary search, but note the difference:
       - In this part, if `mountainArr.get(mid)` is **greater** than the target, you move to the **right** (`s = mid + 1`) because the array is decreasing.
       - If `mountainArr.get(mid)` is **less** than the target, move to the **left** (`e = mid - 1`).

   - **Result:** If the target is found in this decreasing part, the function returns its index. If not, after completing both searches, the function will return `-1`, indicating that the target is not present in the array.

### Summary:
- The algorithm first finds the peak and then performs two binary searches: one on the left (increasing) side and one on the right (decreasing) side of the peak.
- This method ensures that the search is efficient and stays within the constraints, as it only makes a few calls to `MountainArray.get` by leveraging the properties of the mountain array and binary search.

This approach helps find the target quickly, regardless of whether it lies before, at, or after the peak, or if it doesnâ€™t exist in the array at all.

## Constraints:

- `3 <= mountain_arr.length() <= 10^4`
- `0 <= target <= 10^9`
- `0 <= mountain_arr.get(index) <= 10^9`

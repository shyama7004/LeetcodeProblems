Given an array of integers `nums`, calculate the pivot index of this array.

The pivot index is the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers strictly to the index's right.

If the index is on the left edge of the array, then the left sum is 0 because there are no elements to the left. This also applies to the right edge of the array.

Return the leftmost pivot index. If no such index exists, return `-1`.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:** `nums = [1,7,3,6,5,6]`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:**  
The pivot index is 3.  
Left sum = `nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = 1 + 7 + 3 = 11`  
Right sum = `nums[4] + nums[5] = 5 + 6 = 11`

### Example 2:

**Input:** `nums = [1,2,3]`  
**Output:** `-1`  
**Explanation:**  
There is no index that satisfies the conditions in the problem statement.

### Example 3:

**Input:** `nums = [2,1,-1]`  
**Output:** `0`  
**Explanation:**  
The pivot index is 0.  
Left sum = `0` (no elements to the left of index 0)  
Right sum = `nums[1] + nums[2] = 1 + -1 = 0`

## Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
## My nala code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int pivotIndex(vector<int>& nums) {

	int n = num.size();
	int i =1;
	int j =n-1;

	int leftsum = 0;
	int rightsum = 0;

	while(i< n && j > i)
	{
		leftsum = nums[i];
		rightsum = nums[j]
	
		if(leftsum == rigthsum)
		{
		return (i+j)/2;
		}
		else
		{
			
		}

	}
        
    }
};
```

- I did start in right direction but messed up and got trapped in else if statements

## Correct approach
To solve the "Find Pivot Index" problem efficiently, you can follow these steps:

### **Approach and Intuition:**

1. **Calculate the Total Sum:** 
   - First, calculate the total sum of the array elements. This will help in computing the right sum easily by subtracting the left sum and the current element from the total sum.
  
2. **Iterate Through the Array:**
   - As you iterate through the array, maintain a running `leftSum` that keeps track of the sum of elements to the left of the current index.
   - For each index `i`, the right sum can be computed as `totalSum - leftSum - nums[i]`.

3. **Check Pivot Condition:**
   - If at any index `i`, the `leftSum` equals the right sum (`totalSum - leftSum - nums[i]`), then `i` is the pivot index.
   - If no such index is found, return `-1`.

### **Optimized Solution:**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int pivotIndex(vector<int>& nums) {
        int totalSum = 0;
        int leftSum = 0;
        
        // Calculate the total sum of the array
        for (int num : nums) {
            totalSum += num;
        }
        
        // Iterate through the array to find the pivot index
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            // Check if left sum equals right sum
            if (leftSum == totalSum - leftSum - nums[i]) {
                return i;
            }
            // Update the left sum
            leftSum += nums[i];
        }
        
        // If no pivot index is found, return -1
        return -1;
    }
};
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Total Sum Calculation:**
   - We first loop through the array to calculate `totalSum`, which is the sum of all elements in `nums`.

2. **Left and Right Sum Computation:**
   - We initialize `leftSum` to 0 and iterate through the array. 
   - For each element at index `i`, we calculate the right sum as `totalSum - leftSum - nums[i]`.
   - We check if `leftSum` is equal to the right sum. If they are equal, `i` is the pivot index, so we return it.

3. **Updating Left Sum:**
   - After checking the pivot condition for each index, we add `nums[i]` to `leftSum` to update it for the next iteration.

### **Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
  - We pass through the array twice: once to calculate the `totalSum` and once to find the pivot index. Thus, the overall time complexity is linear.

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\)
  - We use only a few extra variables (`totalSum`, `leftSum`) and no additional data structures, so the space complexity is constant.

## Explanation of for (int num : nums)
The loop `for (int num : nums)` is a type of loop in C++ known as a **range-based for loop**. It is used to iterate over the elements of a container, such as an array, `vector`, or other types of collections in a more readable and concise way compared to a traditional `for` loop.

### **Breakdown of the Syntax:**

- **`int num`:** This is the variable that will hold each element of the array (or container) during each iteration of the loop. In this case, `num` will take on the value of each element in the `nums` vector one by one.

- **`nums`:** This is the container being iterated over. Here, it's a `vector<int>` named `nums`, but it could be any container that supports iteration (like arrays, sets, etc.).

### **How It Works:**

When the loop runs, it starts from the first element of the `nums` vector and assigns its value to `num`. On each iteration, the loop moves to the next element in the vector and repeats the process until all elements have been iterated over.

### **Example Usage:**

Here's a simple example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    
    // Range-based for loop to print each element in nums
    for (int num : nums) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
1 2 3 4 5
```

### **Explanation of the Example:**

- **Iteration 1:** `num` is assigned the value `1` (the first element of `nums`).
- **Iteration 2:** `num` is assigned the value `2` (the second element of `nums`).
- **Iteration 3:** `num` is assigned the value `3` (the third element of `nums`).
- **And so on...**

The loop will continue until it has processed all elements in the `nums` vector.

### **Advantages of Range-Based For Loops:**

1. **Readability:** It makes the code cleaner and easier to understand.
2. **Less Error-Prone:** You don't have to manually handle indices and iterators, reducing the risk of off-by-one errors or out-of-bounds access.
3. **Conciseness:** It eliminates the need to declare and manage an index variable explicitly.

### **Comparison to Traditional For Loop:**

A traditional `for` loop for the same task would look like this:

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
    int num = nums[i];
    std::cout << num << " ";
}
```

The range-based for loop is more concise and easier to read, especially when you don't need the index `i`.

### **Note:**
- The range-based for loop iterates over copies of elements by default. If you want to avoid copying, especially with large or complex objects, you can use a reference:
  
  ```cpp
  for (int& num : nums) {
      // num is a reference to each element in nums
  }
  ```

  Here, `int& num` means that `num` is a reference to the elements in `nums`, allowing you to modify the elements directly.

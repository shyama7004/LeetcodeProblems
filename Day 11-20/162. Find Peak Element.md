# 162. Find Peak Element

**Difficulty:** Medium

## Problem Statement

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž`. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:** `nums = [1,2,3,1]`

**Output:** `2`

**Explanation:** `3` is a peak element, and your function should return the index number `2`.

### Example 2:

**Input:** `nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]`

**Output:** `5`

**Explanation:** Your function can return either index number `1` where the peak element is `2`, or index number `5` where the peak element is `6`.

## Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all valid `i`.

## My code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findPeakElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int s = 0;
        int e = nums.size() - 1;

        while (s < e) {
            int mid = s + (e - s) / 2;

            // Compare mid with mid + 1 to decide the direction
            if (nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]) {
                s = mid + 1; // Move to the right
            } else {
                e = mid; // Move to the left, including mid as a potential peak
            }
        }
        return s; // s and e converge to the peak index
    }
};
```

### Key Points:
- **Binary Search:** The loop continues while `s < e`, ensuring the binary search efficiently narrows down the peak element.
- **Comparison:** The code compares `nums[mid]` with `nums[mid + 1]` to determine whether to move to the right or left, ensuring the search is always directed towards the peak.
- **Return:** Once `s` and `e` converge, the index `s` is returned as the peak element.

This version is optimized to prevent TLE and runs in `O(log n)` time complexity.

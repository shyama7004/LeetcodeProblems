Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:** `nums = [2,7,11,15]`, `target = 9`  
**Output:** `[0,1]`  
**Explanation:** Because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`, we return `[0, 1]`.

### Example 2:

**Input:** `nums = [3,2,4]`, `target = 6`  
**Output:** `[1,2]`

### Example 3:

**Input:** `nums = [3,3]`, `target = 6`  
**Output:** `[0,1]`

## Constraints:

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
- Only one valid answer exists.

## Follow-up:

Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(n^2)` time complexity?


# Two Sum Problem Approaches

## Approach 1: Brute Force

### Intuition
The brute force approach is simple. Loop through each element `x` and find if there is another value that equals to `target − x`.

            }

    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                if (nums[j] == target - nums[i]) {
                    return new int[] { i, j };
                }
            }
        }
        // If no valid pair is found, return an empty array instead of null
        return new int[] {};
    }
}
```
</details>

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time complexity**: O(n²)  
  For each element, we try to find its complement by looping through the rest of the array which takes O(n) time. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n²).

- **Space complexity**: O(1)  
  The space required does not depend on the size of the input array, so only constant space is used.

---

## Approach 2: Two-pass Hash Table

### Intuition
To improve our runtime complexity, we need a more efficient way to check if the complement exists in the array.  
If the complement exists, we need to get its index. What is the best way to maintain a mapping of each element in the array to its index? A hash table.

We can reduce the lookup time from O(n) to O(1) by trading space for speed. A hash table is well suited for this purpose because it supports fast lookup in near constant time.  
Lookup in a hash table should be amortized O(1) time as long as the hash function is well-designed.

### Algorithm

1. In the first iteration, add each element's value as a key and its index as a value to the hash table.
2. In the second iteration, check if each element's complement (`target − nums[i]`) exists in the hash table.
3. If it exists, return the current element's index and its complement's index.
4. Ensure that the complement is not the element itself.

### Implementation
*Code not provided in original text.*

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time complexity**: O(n)  
  We traverse the list containing `n` elements exactly twice. Since the hash table reduces the lookup time to O(1), the overall time complexity is O(n).

- **Space complexity**: O(n)  
  The extra space required depends on the number of items stored in the hash table, which stores exactly `n` elements.

---

## Approach 3: One-pass Hash Table

### Algorithm

It turns out we can do it in one-pass.  
While we are iterating and inserting elements into the hash table, we also look back to check if the current element's complement already exists in the hash table.  
If it exists, we have found a solution and return the indices immediately.

### Implementation
*Code not provided in original text.*

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time complexity**: O(n)  
  We traverse the list containing `n` elements only once. Each lookup in the table costs only O(1) time.

- **Space complexity**: O(n)  
  The extra space required depends on the number of items stored in the hash table, which stores at most `n` elements.

### **Non-Optimized Solution (Brute Force)**

#### **Intuition:**
The simplest way to solve the "Two Sum" problem is to check every possible pair of numbers in the array to see if they sum to the target value. This is the most straightforward approach, but it isn't the most efficient.

#### **Approach:**
1. **Nested Loop:** Iterate over each element in the array (`nums[i]`) and for each element, iterate over the remaining elements (`nums[j]`, where `j > i`) to find if any two elements sum to the target.
2. **Check Sum:** For every pair `(i, j)`, check if `nums[i] + nums[j] == target`.
3. **Return Indices:** If a pair is found, return their indices.
4. **Handle No Solution:** If no pair is found after all iterations, return an empty vector (though in the problem statement, it's guaranteed that exactly one solution exists).

#### **Code:**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        vector<int> v;
        int n = nums.size();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                    v.push_back(i);
                    v.push_back(j);
                    return v;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return v;  // Return empty vector if no solution is found
    }
};
```

#### **Hints:**
- **Try All Pairs:** The brute-force approach is about trying all possible pairs in the array and checking if their sum matches the target.
- **Nested Loop:** Think of the array as a grid where you want to check every combination of two different elements.

#### **Time Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n^2)\)
  - You check every pair of elements, and there are \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) possible pairs in an array of size \(n\), leading to \(O(n^2)\) complexity.
  
#### **Space Complexity:**
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\)
  - The only additional space used is for storing the output indices (which is negligible and considered \(O(1)\)).

### **Optimized Solution (Using Hash Map)**

`Note`: If you know what Hash Map is, then skip to the code part :)

### **What is a Hash Map?**

A hash map (or unordered_map in C++) is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It allows you to quickly look up a value based on its key. The key is like an "address" where the corresponding value is stored. 

In simple terms:
- **Key:** A unique identifier used to find the value.
- **Value:** The data associated with the key.

### **How Does a Hash Map Work?**
1. **Hashing:** When you insert a key-value pair into a hash map, the key is passed through a "hash function" that converts it into an index (a number). This index determines where in the hash map the value will be stored.
2. **Constant Time Lookup:** Once the key is hashed to an index, you can retrieve the corresponding value very quickly, usually in \(O(1)\) time on average.
3. **Collision Handling:** If two keys hash to the same index (a collision), the hash map has strategies to handle this, such as chaining (storing multiple values at the same index in a list).

### **Hash Map in the Two Sum Problem:**

The main idea of using a hash map in the "Two Sum" problem is to store numbers you've already seen along with their indices, so you can instantly check if the complement (the number you need to reach the target) has been seen before.

### **Detailed Explanation of the Code:**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        unordered_map<int, int> numMap;  // Create a hash map to store numbers and their indices
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {  // Iterate over the array
            int complement = target - nums[i];  // Calculate the complement
            
            // Check if the complement exists in the map
            if (numMap.find(complement) != numMap.end()) {
                // If it exists, return the indices
                return {numMap[complement], i};
            }
            
            // Store the current number with its index in the map
            numMap[nums[i]] = i;
        }
        
        return {};  // This line is technically not needed since the problem guarantees a solution
    }
};
```

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

1. **Hash Map Initialization:**
   ```cpp
   unordered_map<int, int> numMap;
   ```
   - `unordered_map<int, int>` is a hash map where `int` is both the type of the key and the value. Here, the key is a number from the array, and the value is its index.

2. **Iterate Over the Array:**
   ```cpp
   for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
   ```
   - We loop through each element of the array. `i` is the index of the current element.

3. **Calculate the Complement:**
   ```cpp
   int complement = target - nums[i];
   ```
   - For the current element `nums[i]`, we calculate the complement, which is the number you need to add to `nums[i]` to reach the `target`.

4. **Check if the Complement Exists in the Map:**
   ```cpp
   if (numMap.find(complement) != numMap.end()) {
   ```
   - `numMap.find(complement)` checks if the complement has already been added to the hash map. If `find()` doesn't return `numMap.end()`, it means the complement exists in the map.
   - If the complement exists, it means we've found two numbers that add up to the target.

5. **Return the Indices:**
   ```cpp
   return {numMap[complement], i};
   ```
   - If the complement is found, the indices of the two numbers are returned. `numMap[complement]` gives the index of the complement, and `i` is the index of the current number.

6. **Store the Current Number and Its Index:**
   ```cpp
   numMap[nums[i]] = i;
   ```
   - If the complement is not found, the current number `nums[i]` and its index `i` are stored in the hash map for future reference. This allows the complement of any future number to be found quickly.

### **Why is This Efficient?**

- **Single Pass Through the Array:** The entire array is processed in a single loop, making it very efficient.
- **Instant Lookup:** The use of a hash map allows for instant lookup of the complement, which reduces the time complexity from O(n<sup>2</sup>) in the brute-force method to O(n).

### **Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - We loop through the array once, and each lookup or insertion operation in the hash map is O(1) on average.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - The hash map can store up to n elements (in the worst case where all elements need to be stored).

### **Recap:**

- A hash map is a data structure that allows for quick storage and retrieval of data using keys.
- In the Two Sum problem, it’s used to store numbers and their indices as we iterate through the array.
- For each number, we check if its complement (the number that would sum to the target) is already in the hash map.
- This method significantly improves efficiency compared to the brute-force approach.

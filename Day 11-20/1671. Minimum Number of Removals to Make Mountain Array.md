# 1671. Minimum Number of Removals to Make Mountain Array

## Problem Statement

You may recall that an array `arr` is a mountain array if and only if:
- `arr.length >= 3`
- There exists some index `i` (0-indexed) with `0 < i < arr.length - 1` such that:
  - `arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]`
  - `arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`

Given an integer array `nums`, return the minimum number of elements to remove to make `nums` a mountain array.

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The array itself is a mountain array, so we do not need to remove any elements.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [2,1,1,5,6,2,3,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: One solution is to remove the elements at indices 0, 1, and 5, making the array nums = [1,5,6,3,1].
```

### Constraints:
- `3 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- It is guaranteed that you can make a mountain array out of `nums`.

## Approach & Intuition

To solve this problem, we need to identify the longest subarray that forms a mountain shape and then determine how many elements need to be removed to achieve this subarray.

### Steps:
1. **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) from the Left:**
   - For each index `i`, compute the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at `i`.
   
2. **Longest Decreasing Subsequence (LDS) from the Right:**
   - For each index `i`, compute the length of the longest decreasing subsequence starting at `i`.

3. **Valid Mountain Array:**
   - A valid peak exists at index `i` if both `LIS[i] > 1` and `LDS[i] > 1`.
   - The length of the mountain array with peak at `i` is `LIS[i] + LDS[i] - 1`.

4. **Minimum Removals:**
   - The minimum number of removals needed is `nums.length - maximum mountain length`.

### Optimized Solution

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumMountainRemovals(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> lis(n, 1), lds(n, 1);

        // Compute LIS for each index
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                    lis[i] = max(lis[i], lis[j] + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        // Compute LDS for each index
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
            for (int j = n - 1; j > i; --j) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                    lds[i] = max(lds[i], lds[j] + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        int maxMountainLength = 0;

        // Find the maximum length of a mountain array
        for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            if (lis[i] > 1 && lds[i] > 1) {  // Peak must have both LIS and LDS
                maxMountainLength = max(maxMountainLength, lis[i] + lds[i] - 1);
            }
        }

        // Minimum removals needed to form the mountain array
        return n - maxMountainLength;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
- **LIS and LDS Computation:** By computing the LIS from the left and LDS from the right, we effectively determine how long the increasing and decreasing parts of the array can be, centered around each possible peak.
- **Final Calculation:** The goal is to maximize the length of the valid mountain subarray, and the number of removals is determined by subtracting this length from the total number of elements in `nums`.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n^2)`, where `n` is the length of the input array. This is due to the nested loops required to compute the LIS and LDS.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, for the `lis` and `lds` arrays.

This solution efficiently finds the minimum number of removals required to transform the given array into a valid mountain array.

# 1671. Minimum Number of Removals to Make Mountain Array

## Problem Statement

You may recall that an array `arr` is a mountain array if and only if:
- `arr.length >= 3`
- There exists some index `i` (0-indexed) with `0 < i < arr.length - 1` such that:
  - `arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]`
  - `arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`

Given an integer array `nums`, return the minimum number of elements to remove to make `nums` a mountain array.

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The array itself is a mountain array, so we do not need to remove any elements.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [2,1,1,5,6,2,3,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: One solution is to remove the elements at indices 0, 1, and 5, making the array nums = [1,5,6,3,1].
```

### Constraints:
- `3 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- It is guaranteed that you can make a mountain array out of `nums`.

## Approach & Intuition

To solve this problem, we need to identify the longest subarray that forms a mountain shape and then determine how many elements need to be removed to achieve this subarray.

### Steps:
1. **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) from the Left:**
   - For each index `i`, compute the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at `i`.
   
2. **Longest Decreasing Subsequence (LDS) from the Right:**
   - For each index `i`, compute the length of the longest decreasing subsequence starting at `i`.

3. **Valid Mountain Array:**
   - A valid peak exists at index `i` if both `LIS[i] > 1` and `LDS[i] > 1`.
   - The length of the mountain array with peak at `i` is `LIS[i] + LDS[i] - 1`.

4. **Minimum Removals:**
   - The minimum number of removals needed is `nums.length - maximum mountain length`.

### Optimized Solution

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumMountainRemovals(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> lis(n, 1), lds(n, 1);

        // Compute LIS for each index
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                    lis[i] = max(lis[i], lis[j] + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        // Compute LDS for each index
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
            for (int j = n - 1; j > i; --j) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                    lds[i] = max(lds[i], lds[j] + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        int maxMountainLength = 0;

        // Find the maximum length of a mountain array
        for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            if (lis[i] > 1 && lds[i] > 1) {  // Peak must have both LIS and LDS
                maxMountainLength = max(maxMountainLength, lis[i] + lds[i] - 1);
            }
        }

        // Minimum removals needed to form the mountain array
        return n - maxMountainLength;
    }
};

## Explanation

### Includes and Namespace
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
```
- **`#include <vector>`**: Includes the vector library, which allows the use of the `vector` container.
- **`#include <algorithm>`**: Includes the algorithm library, providing functions like `max`.
- **`using namespace std;`**: Allows the use of standard library names like `vector` and `max` without the `std::` prefix.

### Class and Function Definition
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumMountainRemovals(vector<int>& nums) {
```
- **`class Solution`**: Defines a class named `Solution`.
- **`int minimumMountainRemovals(vector<int>& nums)`**: A public method of `Solution` that takes a vector of integers (`nums`) as input and returns an integer.

### Initialization
```cpp
int n = nums.size();
vector<int> lis(n, 1), lds(n, 1);
```
- **`int n = nums.size();`**: Gets the size of the `nums` vector.
- **`vector<int> lis(n, 1), lds(n, 1);`**: Initializes two vectors, `lis` (Longest Increasing Subsequence) and `lds` (Longest Decreasing Subsequence), both of size `n` and filled with `1`.

### Compute Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
```cpp
for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
        if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
            lis[i] = max(lis[i], lis[j] + 1);
        }
    }
}
```
- **Outer loop (`for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)`)**: Iterates through each element in `nums` starting from the second element.
- **Inner loop (`for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j)`)**: Iterates through the elements before `i`.
- **`if (nums[i] > nums[j])`**: Checks if the current element `nums[i]` is greater than `nums[j]`.
- **`lis[i] = max(lis[i], lis[j] + 1);`**: Updates `lis[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `lis[j] + 1`, representing the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`.

### Compute Longest Decreasing Subsequence (LDS)
```cpp
for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
    for (int j = n - 1; j > i; --j) {
        if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
            lds[i] = max(lds[i], lds[j] + 1);
        }
    }
}
```
- **Outer loop (`for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i)`)**: Iterates backward from the second-to-last element to the first element.
- **Inner loop (`for (int j = n - 1; j > i; --j)`)**: Iterates backward from the last element to the element after `i`.
- **`if (nums[i] > nums[j])`**: Checks if the current element `nums[i]` is greater than `nums[j]`.
- **`lds[i] = max(lds[i], lds[j] + 1);`**: Updates `lds[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `lds[j] + 1`, representing the length of the longest decreasing subsequence starting at index `i`.

### Find Maximum Length of a Mountain Array
```cpp
int maxMountainLength = 0;

for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; ++i) {
    if (lis[i] > 1 && lds[i] > 1) {
        maxMountainLength = max(maxMountainLength, lis[i] + lds[i] - 1);
    }
}
```
- **`int maxMountainLength = 0;`**: Initializes a variable to keep track of the maximum length of a valid mountain array.
- **Loop (`for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; ++i)`)**: Iterates through the array from the second element to the second-to-last element.
- **`if (lis[i] > 1 && lds[i] > 1)`**: Checks if the current element `i` can be a peak (it needs to be part of both an increasing and decreasing subsequence).
- **`maxMountainLength = max(maxMountainLength, lis[i] + lds[i] - 1);`**: Updates `maxMountainLength` to be the maximum length of a mountain found so far.

### Return the Result
```cpp
return n - maxMountainLength;
```
- **`return n - maxMountainLength;`**: Returns the minimum number of removals needed to form a mountain array, which is the total number of elements minus the length of the longest mountain array found.

### Summary
This function calculates the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the array `nums` to create a "mountain array." A mountain array is an array that strictly increases and then strictly decreases, and the peak element is not at the beginning or end of the array. The algorithm does this by calculating the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) and Longest Decreasing Subsequence (LDS) for each element, then finding the maximum length of the mountain array, and finally calculating the number of elements that need to be removed.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n^2)`, where `n` is the length of the input array. This is due to the nested loops required to compute the LIS and LDS.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, for the `lis` and `lds` arrays.

This solution efficiently finds the minimum number of removals required to transform the given array into a valid mountain array.

# 69. Sqrt(x)

## Problem Statement
Given a non-negative integer `x`, return the square root of `x` rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use `pow(x, 0.5)` in C++ or `x ** 0.5` in Python.

## Example 1:
**Input:**  
`x = 4`

**Output:**  
`2`

**Explanation:**  
The square root of `4` is `2`, so we return `2`.

## Example 2:
**Input:**  
`x = 8`

**Output:**  
`2`

**Explanation:**  
The square root of `8` is `2.82842...`, and since we round it down to the nearest integer, `2` is returned.

## Constraints:
- `0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1`

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long int binarySearch(int n) {
        int s = 0;
        int e = n;
        long long int mid = s + (e - s) / 2;
        long long int ans = -1;

        while (s <= e) {
            long long int square = mid * mid;

            if (square == n) {
                return mid;
            } else if (square < n) {
                ans = mid;
                s = mid + 1;
            } else {
                e = mid - 1;
            }

            mid = s + (e - s) / 2;
        }

        return ans;
    }

    int mySqrt(int x) {
        return binarySearch(x);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **`if(square == n)` Condition:** This check should come first. If the square is equal to `n`, return `mid` immediately. This avoids unnecessary updates to `s` or `e`.
2. **`else if` instead of `if` for `square < n`:** This ensures that the next block (`e = mid - 1;`) only executes if the square is greater than `n`. 

This should give you the correct integer square root of `x`.

In the context of the binary search algorithm you've implemented, the "search space" refers to the range of potential values that you're exploring to find the solution. 

### Understanding Search Space

1. **Initial Search Space:**
   - When you start the binary search for finding the square root of a number `n`, the search space is defined by the range of values from `0` to `n`.
   - For example, if you're finding the square root of `16`, the initial search space would be `[0, 16]`.

2. **Shrinking the Search Space:**
   - The key idea in binary search is to continually reduce the size of this search space by half, making the search more efficient.
   - At each step, you calculate the midpoint `mid` of the current search space.
   - Depending on the comparison of `mid * mid` with `n`, you either:
     - **Move to the right half** of the search space (i.e., update `s = mid + 1`) if `mid * mid < n`.
     - **Move to the left half** of the search space (i.e., update `e = mid - 1`) if `mid * mid > n`.
   - This process continues until the search space is reduced to a single point, or until you find the exact value where `mid * mid == n`.

3. **Final Search Space:**
   - When the search space is reduced to the point where `s > e`, the loop ends, and you've either found the exact square root or the integer part of it.

### Visualization of Search Space

Let's say you're finding the square root of `10`:

- **Initial Search Space:** `[0, 10]`
- **First Iteration:** Calculate `mid = (0 + 10) / 2 = 5`. Since `5 * 5 = 25 > 10`, the new search space becomes `[0, 4]`.
- **Second Iteration:** Calculate `mid = (0 + 4) / 2 = 2`. Since `2 * 2 = 4 < 10`, the new search space becomes `[3, 4]`.
- **Third Iteration:** Calculate `mid = (3 + 4) / 2 = 3`. Since `3 * 3 = 9 < 10`, the new search space becomes `[4, 4]`.
- **Final Iteration:** Calculate `mid = 4`. Since `4 * 4 = 16 > 10`, the new search space becomes `[3, 3]`.

At this point, the search space can't shrink any further, so the loop ends, and the closest integer square root is `3`.

### Key Points:
- **Efficiency:** By halving the search space at each step, binary search significantly reduces the number of comparisons needed, leading to a time complexity of \(O(\log n)\).
- **Search Space in Algorithms:** The concept of search space isn't limited to binary searchâ€”it's a general idea used in various algorithms (e.g., optimization problems, decision problems) where the solution is found by exploring and narrowing down a range of possibilities.

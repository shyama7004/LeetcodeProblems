# 69. Sqrt(x)

## Problem Statement
Given a non-negative integer `x`, return the square root of `x` rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use `pow(x, 0.5)` in C++ or `x ** 0.5` in Python.

## Example 1:
**Input:**  
`x = 4`

**Output:**  
`2`

**Explanation:**  
The square root of `4` is `2`, so we return `2`.

## Example 2:
**Input:**  
`x = 8`

**Output:**  
`2`

**Explanation:**  
The square root of `8` is `2.82842...`, and since we round it down to the nearest integer, `2` is returned.

## Constraints:
- `0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1`

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long int binarySearch(int n) {
        int s = 0;
        int e = n;
        long long int mid = s + (e - s) / 2;
        long long int ans = -1;

        while (s <= e) {
            long long int square = mid * mid;

            if (square == n) {
                return mid;
            } else if (square < n) {
                ans = mid;
                s = mid + 1;
            } else {
                e = mid - 1;
            }

            mid = s + (e - s) / 2;
        }

        return ans;
    }

    int mySqrt(int x) {
        return binarySearch(x);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **`if(square == n)` Condition:** This check should come first. If the square is equal to `n`, return `mid` immediately. This avoids unnecessary updates to `s` or `e`.
2. **`else if` instead of `if` for `square < n`:** This ensures that the next block (`e = mid - 1;`) only executes if the square is greater than `n`. 

This should give you the correct integer square root of `x`.

<summary>Click here to know about Search Space</summary>

In the context of the binary search algorithm you've implemented, the "search space" refers to the range of potential values that you're exploring to find the solution. 

### Understanding Search Space

1. **Initial Search Space:**
   - When you start the binary search for finding the square root of a number `n`, the search space is defined by the range of values from `0` to `n`.
   - For example, if you're finding the square root of `16`, the initial search space would be `[0, 16]`.

2. **Shrinking the Search Space:**
   - The key idea in binary search is to continually reduce the size of this search space by half, making the search more efficient.
   - At each step, you calculate the midpoint `mid` of the current search space.
   - Depending on the comparison of `mid * mid` with `n`, you either:
     - **Move to the right half** of the search space (i.e., update `s = mid + 1`) if `mid * mid < n`.
     - **Move to the left half** of the search space (i.e., update `e = mid - 1`) if `mid * mid > n`.
   - This process continues until the search space is reduced to a single point, or until you find the exact value where `mid * mid == n`.

3. **Final Search Space:**
   - When the search space is reduced to the point where `s > e`, the loop ends, and you've either found the exact square root or the integer part of it.

### Visualization of Search Space

Let's say you're finding the square root of `10`:

- **Initial Search Space:** `[0, 10]`
- **First Iteration:** Calculate `mid = (0 + 10) / 2 = 5`. Since `5 * 5 = 25 > 10`, the new search space becomes `[0, 4]`.
- **Second Iteration:** Calculate `mid = (0 + 4) / 2 = 2`. Since `2 * 2 = 4 < 10`, the new search space becomes `[3, 4]`.
- **Third Iteration:** Calculate `mid = (3 + 4) / 2 = 3`. Since `3 * 3 = 9 < 10`, the new search space becomes `[4, 4]`.
- **Final Iteration:** Calculate `mid = 4`. Since `4 * 4 = 16 > 10`, the new search space becomes `[3, 3]`.

At this point, the search space can't shrink any further, so the loop ends, and the closest integer square root is `3`.

### Key Points:
- **Efficiency:** By halving the search space at each step, binary search significantly reduces the number of comparisons needed, leading to a time complexity of \(O(\log n)\).
- **Search Space in Algorithms:** The concept of search space isn't limited to binary search—it's a general idea used in various algorithms (e.g., optimization problems, decision problems) where the solution is found by exploring and narrowing down a range of possibilities.

double morePrecision(int n, int precision, int tempSol) {
    
    double factor = 1;
    double ans = tempSol;

    for(int i=0; i<precision; i++) {
        factor = factor/10;

        for(double j=ans; j*j<n; j=j+factor ){
            ans = j;
        }
    }
    return ans;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout <<" Enter the number " << endl;
    cin >> n;

    int tempSol = sqrtInteger(n);
    cout <<" Answer is " << morePrecision(n, 3, tempSol) << endl;

    return 0;
}

```
### Code Breakdown:

```cpp
double morePrecision(int n, int precision, int tempSol) {
```

- This function takes three arguments:
  - `n`: The number whose square root you want to find.
  - `precision`: The number of decimal places of precision you want for the square root.
  - `tempSol`: The integer part of the square root found by the `sqrtInteger` function.

- The function returns a `double`, which is the square root of `n` with the desired precision.

```cpp
double factor = 1;
double ans = tempSol;
```

- `factor = 1;` initializes a variable `factor` which will be used to adjust the step size for refining the square root.
- `ans = tempSol;` assigns the integer part of the square root (`tempSol`) to `ans`. This will be the starting point for finding the more precise square root.

```cpp
for(int i=0; i<precision; i++) {
```

- This loop runs `precision` times, where `precision` is the number of decimal places you want. Each iteration of this loop adds one more decimal place of precision to `ans`.

```cpp
factor = factor/10;
```

- In each iteration, `factor` is divided by 10. This reduces `factor` by one decimal place (e.g., 1 → 0.1 → 0.01 → 0.001, etc.).
- This allows the algorithm to zoom in on the square root with finer precision.

```cpp
for(double j=ans; j*j<n; j=j+factor ){
    ans = j;
}
```

- **Inner Loop Initialization (`double j=ans;`)**: 
  - This loop starts `j` at the current value of `ans`.
  
- **Condition (`j*j < n;`)**: 
  - The loop continues as long as `j*j` (i.e., the square of `j`) is less than `n`.
  - This loop searches for the largest `j` where `j*j` is still less than `n`.
  
- **Increment (`j=j+factor`)**: 
  - `j` is incremented by `factor`, which is currently a small value like 0.1, 0.01, etc., depending on the iteration.
  - This incremental search adds more precision to the square root.

- **Update (`ans = j;`)**: 
  - `ans` is updated to the last value of `j` that still satisfies `j*j < n`.
  - This value of `ans` is the best approximation found so far at the current precision level.

```cpp
return ans;
```

- After the loop completes, `ans` contains the square root of `n` with the desired number of decimal places of precision.
- The function returns `ans`.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's say you're calculating the square root of `50` with `precision = 3`:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - `tempSol` from `sqrtInteger(50)` might be `7` (because `7*7=49` is the closest integer square root).
   - `factor = 1; ans = 7.0;`

2. **First Iteration (`i = 0`):**
   - `factor` becomes `0.1`.
   - The inner loop increments `j` from `7.0` in steps of `0.1` (i.e., `7.1`, `7.2`, ...).
   - It stops when `j = 7.0` because `7.1 * 7.1 = 50.41`, which exceeds `50`.
   - `ans` is updated to `7.0`.

3. **Second Iteration (`i = 1`):**
   - `factor` becomes `0.01`.
   - The inner loop increments `j` from `7.0` in steps of `0.01` (i.e., `7.01`, `7.02`, ...).
   - It stops when `j = 7.07` because `7.08 * 7.08 = 50.1136`, which exceeds `50`.
   - `ans` is updated to `7.07`.

4. **Third Iteration (`i = 2`):**
   - `factor` becomes `0.001`.
   - The inner loop increments `j` from `7.07` in steps of `0.001` (i.e., `7.071`, `7.072`, ...).
   - It stops when `j = 7.071` because `7.072 * 7.072 = 50.000519`, which exceeds `50`.
   - `ans` is updated to `7.071`.

5. **Return:**
   - The function returns `7.071`, which is the square root of `50` with three decimal places of precision.
### Summary:
The code calculates the square root of a number `n` using binary search for the integer part and then refines it to a specified precision using incremental adjustments.

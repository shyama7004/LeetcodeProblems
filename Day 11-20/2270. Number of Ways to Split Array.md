## Hint
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of length `n`.

`nums` contains a valid split at index `i` if the following are true:
- The sum of the first `i + 1` elements is greater than or equal to the sum of the last `n - i - 1` elements.
- There is at least one element to the right of `i`. That is, `0 <= i < n - 1`.

Return the number of valid splits in `nums`.

## Example 1:

**Input:** `nums = [10,4,-8,7]`  
**Output:** `2`  

**Explanation:**  
There are three ways of splitting `nums` into two non-empty parts:
- Split `nums` at index 0. Then, the first part is `[10]`, and its sum is `10`. The second part is `[4,-8,7]`, and its sum is `3`. Since `10 >= 3`, `i = 0` is a valid split.
- Split `nums` at index 1. Then, the first part is `[10,4]`, and its sum is `14`. The second part is `[-8,7]`, and its sum is `-1`. Since `14 >= -1`, `i = 1` is a valid split.
- Split `nums` at index 2. Then, the first part is `[10,4,-8]`, and its sum is `6`. The second part is `[7]`, and its sum is `7`. Since `6 < 7`, `i = 2` is not a valid split.

Thus, the number of valid splits in `nums` is `2`.

## Example 2:

**Input:** `nums = [2,3,1,0]`  
**Output:** `2`  

**Explanation:**  
There are two valid splits in `nums`:
- Split `nums` at index 1. Then, the first part is `[2,3]`, and its sum is `5`. The second part is `[1,0]`, and its sum is `1`. Since `5 >= 1`, `i = 1` is a valid split. 
- Split `nums` at index 2. Then, the first part is `[2,3,1]`, and its sum is `6`. The second part is `[0]`, and its sum is `0`. Since `6 >= 0`, `i = 2` is a valid split.

## Constraints:
- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int waysToSplitArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        long long total_sum = 0;
        long long left_sum = 0;
        int valid_splits = 0;
        
        // Calculate the total sum of the array
        for (int num : nums) {
            total_sum += num;
        }
        
        // Iterate till the second last element (i < n-1)
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; ++i) {
            left_sum += nums[i];
            long long right_sum = total_sum - left_sum;
            
            if (left_sum >= right_sum) {
                ++valid_splits;
            }
        }
        
        return valid_splits;
    }
};
```
## Explanation

The code finds the number of valid subarray splits in `nums` where the sum of the left part is greater than or equal to the sum of the right part.

1. **Variables**:
   - `total_sum` and `left_sum`: Use `long long` to handle large sums safely.
   - `valid_splits`: Counts the number of valid splits.

2. **Steps**:
   - Calculate `total_sum` of all elements.
   - Iterate through `nums` (except the last element).
   - Update `left_sum` and calculate `right_sum` as `total_sum - left_sum`.
   - If `left_sum >= right_sum`, increment `valid_splits`.

3. **Key Point**:
   - The loop runs until `i < nums.size() - 1` to ensure thereâ€™s at least one element on the right side in each split.

### Using `long long` instead of `int` prevents overflow due to large sums. 

### Key Points:
1. **Constraints**:
   - `nums[i]` can be as large as `10^5` with an array size of up to `10^5`.
  
2. **Overflow Risk**:
   - The maximum sum can reach `10^10`, exceeding the `int` range (`-2.1 billion to 2.1 billion`).

3. **Why `long long`?**:
   - `long long` handles sums up to `9.2 quintillion`, safely covering all scenarios.

4. **Example**:
   - For an array of `100,000` elements, each being `100,000`, the sum `10^10` would overflow `int`.

**Conclusion**: Using `long long` ensures accurate results across all inputs.

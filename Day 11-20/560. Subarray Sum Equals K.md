Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the total number of subarrays whose sum equals `k`.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:** `nums = [1,1,1]`, `k = 2`  
**Output:** `2`

### Example 2:

**Input:** `nums = [1,2,3]`, `k = 3`  
**Output:** `2`

## Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `-10^7 <= k <= 10^7`

## My nala code(Brute force method)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int subarraySum(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int count = 0;
        int n = nums.size();

        // Loop to find all subarrays
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int sum = 0; // Reset sum for each new starting point
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                sum += nums[j];
                if (sum == k) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }

        return count; // Return the total count of subarrays
    }
};
```
To optimize the given code, we can use a hashmap (or unordered_map in C++) to store the cumulative sum up to each index. This allows us to check if a subarray with the sum `k` exists in constant time. This approach reduces the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int subarraySum(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        unordered_map<int, int> sumCount;
        int count = 0;
        int sum = 0;

        sumCount[0] = 1; // To handle the case when the subarray starts from index 0

        for (int num : nums) {
            sum += num;
            if (sumCount.find(sum - k) != sumCount.end()) {
                count += sumCount[sum - k];
            }
            sumCount[sum]++;
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```

### Approach, Intuition, and Logic

**Approach:**
1. Use a hashmap to store the cumulative sum up to each index.
2. Traverse through the array while maintaining the cumulative sum.
3. For each element, check if the cumulative sum minus `k` exists in the hashmap. If it does, add the frequency of that sum to the count.
4. Update the hashmap with the current cumulative sum.

**Intuition:**
- By keeping track of the cumulative sums, we can efficiently check if there exists a previous cumulative sum that, when subtracted from the current cumulative sum, equals `k`.
- This allows us to count the number of subarrays that sum to `k` in linear time.

**Logic:**
- If `sum` is the cumulative sum up to the current index and `sum - k` is a previously seen cumulative sum, it means the subarray between the previous index and the current index sums to `k`.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This is because we only traverse the array once.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(n) as well, due to the storage required for the hashmap to store the cumulative sums.

This optimized approach significantly improves the performance by reducing the time complexity from quadratic to linear.

Sure! Let's go through the explanation of the optimized code step-by-step:

### Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - We declare an unordered_map `sumCount` to store the cumulative sums and their frequencies.
   - `count` is initialized to 0, which will hold the total number of subarrays that sum to `k`.
   - `sum` is initialized to 0, which will store the cumulative sum of the elements as we iterate through the array.
   - We set `sumCount[0] = 1` to handle the case where a subarray that starts from the beginning of the array sums to `k`.

2. **Iterate through the array:**
   - For each element `num` in `nums`, we add it to the `sum`.
   - We then check if `sum - k` exists in `sumCount`. If it does, it means there is a subarray that sums to `k`. We add the frequency of `sum - k` to `count`.
   - Finally, we update the `sumCount` map to include the current `sum`.

3. **Return the result:**
   - After iterating through the entire array, we return `count`, which holds the total number of subarrays that sum to `k`.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Initialization:**
   ```cpp
   unordered_map<int, int> sumCount;
   int count = 0;
   int sum = 0;
   sumCount[0] = 1; // To handle the case when the subarray starts from index 0
   ```

2. **Iterate through the array:**
   - For each element in the array, update the cumulative sum.
   - Check if the difference `sum - k` is in the map. If it is, add the count of `sum - k` to `count` because it indicates that there is a subarray ending at the current index that sums to `k`.
   - Update the map with the current cumulative sum.
   
   Example iteration:
   ```cpp
   for (int num : nums) {
       sum += num;
       if (sumCount.find(sum - k) != sumCount.end()) {
           count += sumCount[sum - k];
       }
       sumCount[sum]++;
   }
   ```

### Example Walkthrough

Let's consider an example where `nums = [1, 1, 1]` and `k = 2`:

- Initialize: `sumCount = {0: 1}`, `count = 0`, `sum = 0`
- Iterate through `nums`:
  - First element `1`:
    - `sum = 1`
    - `sum - k = 1 - 2 = -1` (not in `sumCount`)
    - Update `sumCount`: `{0: 1, 1: 1}`
  - Second element `1`:
    - `sum = 2`
    - `sum - k = 2 - 2 = 0` (found in `sumCount` with frequency 1)
    - `count += 1` → `count = 1`
    - Update `sumCount`: `{0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1}`
  - Third element `1`:
    - `sum = 3`
    - `sum - k = 3 - 2 = 1` (found in `sumCount` with frequency 1)
    - `count += 1` → `count = 2`
    - Update `sumCount`: `{0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1}`
- Return `count`: `2`

### Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: We iterate through the array once, performing constant time operations for each element.

### Space Complexity
- **O(n)**: In the worst case, the hashmap stores the cumulative sum at each index, requiring space proportional to the number of elements in the array.

This approach efficiently counts the number of subarrays that sum to `k` using a hashmap to keep track of cumulative sums, achieving a significant improvement in performance over the naive O(n^2) solution.

## Problem Description

You are given an integer mountain array `arr` of length `n` where the values increase to a peak element and then decrease.

Return the index of the peak element.

Your task is to solve it in `O(log(n))` time complexity.

## Example 1:

**Input:** `arr = [0,1,0]`  
**Output:** `1`

## Example 2:

**Input:** `arr = [0,2,1,0]`  
**Output:** `1`

## Example 3:

**Input:** `arr = [0,10,5,2]`  
**Output:** `1`

## Constraints:

- `3 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= arr[i] <= 10^6`
- `arr` is guaranteed to be a mountain array.

## My nala code(you could have reached to solution if you had applied binary search method properly)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int peakIndexInMountainArray(vector<int>& arr) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = arr.size()-1;
        int max = 0;

        while(start<=end)
        {
            if(arr[start]<arr[end])
            {
                if (arr[start]<arr[start+1])
                {   
                    max = start +1;
                }
                max = start;
                start++;
                end--;
            }

            else
            {
                if(arr[end]<arr[end-1])
                {
                    max = end-1;
                }
                max = end;
                start++;
                end--;
            }
            
        }
        return max;
    }
};
```
Hereâ€™s the corrected version of your code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int peakIndexInMountainArray(vector<int>& arr) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = arr.size() - 1;

        while (start < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;

            // Check if mid is greater than the next element, implying a peak or a descending slope.
            if (arr[mid] > arr[mid + 1]) {
                end = mid;
            } else {
                start = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        // When the loop exits, start and end will point to the peak element.
        return start;
    }
};
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Binary Search**: Instead of manually updating `start` and `end`, the code now uses a binary search approach, which is optimal for finding the peak in a "mountain" array.
2. **Removed Redundant Conditions**: The previous version had unnecessary comparisons and assignments that could cause incorrect results. The updated version checks the mid-point and adjusts the search range accordingly.
3. **Single Loop Exit Condition**: The loop exits when `start` equals `end`, pointing directly to the peak index.

This version ensures an O(log n) time complexity, which is efficient for large arrays.

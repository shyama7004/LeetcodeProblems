# 2460. Apply Operations to an Array

You are given a 0-indexed array `nums` of size `n` consisting of non-negative integers.

You need to apply `n - 1` operations to this array where, in the `i`-th operation (0-indexed), you will apply the following on the `i`-th element of `nums`:

- If `nums[i] == nums[i + 1]`, then multiply `nums[i]` by 2 and set `nums[i + 1]` to 0. Otherwise, you skip this operation.
- After performing all the operations, shift all the 0's to the end of the array.

For example, the array `[1,0,2,0,0,1]` after shifting all its 0's to the end, is `[1,2,1,0,0,0]`.

Return the resulting array.

**Note:** The operations are applied sequentially, not all at once.

## Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,2,2,1,1,0]
Output: [1,4,2,0,0,0]
```

**Explanation:**  
We do the following operations:
- `i = 0`: `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` are not equal, so we skip this operation.
- `i = 1`: `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` are equal, we multiply `nums[1]` by 2 and change `nums[2]` to 0. The array becomes `[1,4,0,1,1,0]`.
- `i = 2`: `nums[2]` and `nums[3]` are not equal, so we skip this operation.
- `i = 3`: `nums[3]` and `nums[4]` are equal, we multiply `nums[3]` by 2 and change `nums[4]` to 0. The array becomes `[1,4,0,2,0,0]`.
- `i = 4`: `nums[4]` and `nums[5]` are equal, we multiply `nums[4]` by 2 and change `nums[5]` to 0. The array becomes `[1,4,0,2,0,0]`.

After that, we shift the 0's to the end, which gives the array `[1,4,2,0,0,0]`.

## Example 2:

```plaintext
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: [1,0]
```

**Explanation:**  
No operation can be applied, we just shift the 0 to the end.

## Constraints:

- `2 <= nums.length <= 2000`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

## Code(My Nala Code)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to move all zeroes to the end while maintaining the order of non-zero elements
    void moveZeroes(vector<int>& nums) {
        int i = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < nums.size(); j++) {
            if (nums[j] != 0) {
                swap(nums[j], nums[i]);
                i++;
            }
        }
    }

    // Function to double the elements if they are the same and set the next element to zero
    vector<int> applyOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; i++) {  // Ensure i+1 is within bounds
            if (nums[i] == nums[i + 1]) {
                nums[i] = 2 * nums[i];
                nums[i + 1] = 0;
            }
        }
        return nums;
    }
};
```
## Corrected version:)
The primary issue with my code is that the two functions `moveZeroes` and `applyOperations` are not called in sequence. In the LeetCode problem, I need to apply both operations in a specific order:

1. First, apply the `applyOperations` function to double elements and set the next element to zero.
2. Then, call the `moveZeroes` function to move all zeros to the end of the array.

To make it work as intended, I need a single function that combines both operations in the correct sequence. Here is the corrected implementation:

### Combined and Corrected Code

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> applyOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Step 1: Apply the specified operations to double elements and set the next element to zero
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] == nums[i + 1]) {
                nums[i] = 2 * nums[i];
                nums[i + 1] = 0;
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Move all zeros to the end while maintaining the order of non-zero elements
        int i = 0;  // Pointer for the position of the next non-zero element
        for (int j = 0; j < nums.size(); ++j) {
            if (nums[j] != 0) {
                swap(nums[j], nums[i]);
                i++;
            }
        }

        return nums;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of Combined Code

Let's break down the given code to understand how it works, especially focusing on the second part where zeros are moved to the end while maintaining the order of non-zero elements.

### Overview of the Code

The `applyOperations` function performs two main tasks:
1. It modifies the input vector `nums` by doubling elements that are the same as the next element and setting the next element to zero.
2. It moves all zeros to the end of the vector while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Doubling Elements and Setting the Next Element to Zero:**
   ```cpp
   for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; ++i) {
       if (nums[i] == nums[i + 1]) {
           nums[i] = 2 * nums[i];
           nums[i + 1] = 0;
       }
   }
   ```
   This loop iterates through the vector `nums` up to the second-to-last element. For each element, it checks if it is equal to the next element. If they are equal, it doubles the current element and sets the next element to zero.

2. **Moving All Zeros to the End:**
   ```cpp
   int i = 0;  // Pointer for the position of the next non-zero element
   for (int j = 0; j < nums.size(); ++j) {
       if (nums[j] != 0) {
           swap(nums[j], nums[i]);
           i++;
       }
   }
   ```

   Let's analyze how this part works:
   
   - `int i = 0;`: This initializes an index `i` which will be used to track the position where the next non-zero element should be placed.
   - `for (int j = 0; j < nums.size(); ++j)`: This loop iterates through the entire vector `nums` with index `j`.
   - `if (nums[j] != 0)`: For each element `nums[j]`, it checks if the element is non-zero.
     - If the element is non-zero, it swaps the element at `nums[j]` with the element at `nums[i]`.
     - After the swap, it increments `i` to point to the next position where a non-zero element should be placed.

### Example to Illustrate

Let's take an example to see how this works:

Initial vector:
```
nums = [2, 2, 0, 4, 4]
```

**Step 1: Doubling Elements and Setting the Next Element to Zero**

After the first loop:
```
nums = [4, 0, 0, 8, 0]
```

Explanation:
- `2` is doubled to `4` and the next element is set to `0`.
- `4` is doubled to `8` and the next element is set to `0`.

**Step 2: Moving All Zeros to the End**

Initial state before the second loop:
```
nums = [4, 0, 0, 8, 0]
i = 0
```

- For `j = 0`: `nums[0]` is `4` (non-zero), swap `nums[0]` with `nums[0]`, increment `i` to `1`.
- For `j = 1`: `nums[1]` is `0`, no action, `i` remains `1`.
- For `j = 2`: `nums[2]` is `0`, no action, `i` remains `1`.
- For `j = 3`: `nums[3]` is `8` (non-zero), swap `nums[3]` with `nums[1]`, increment `i` to `2`.
  ```
  nums = [4, 8, 0, 0, 0]
  ```
- For `j = 4`: `nums[4]` is `0`, no action, `i` remains `2`.

Final state of the vector:
```
nums = [4, 8, 0, 0, 0]
```

### Conclusion

The `int i = 0` and the subsequent loop effectively moves all non-zero elements to the front of the vector while maintaining their relative order, and places all zeros at the end. The variable `i` acts as the index where the next non-zero element should be placed, ensuring the required order is maintained.

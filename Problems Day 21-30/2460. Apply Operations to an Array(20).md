# 2460. Apply Operations to an Array

You are given a 0-indexed array `nums` of size `n` consisting of non-negative integers.

You need to apply `n - 1` operations to this array where, in the `i`-th operation (0-indexed), you will apply the following on the `i`-th element of `nums`:

- If `nums[i] == nums[i + 1]`, then multiply `nums[i]` by 2 and set `nums[i + 1]` to 0. Otherwise, you skip this operation.
- After performing all the operations, shift all the 0's to the end of the array.

For example, the array `[1,0,2,0,0,1]` after shifting all its 0's to the end, is `[1,2,1,0,0,0]`.

Return the resulting array.

**Note:** The operations are applied sequentially, not all at once.

## Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,2,2,1,1,0]
Output: [1,4,2,0,0,0]
```

**Explanation:**  
We do the following operations:
- `i = 0`: `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` are not equal, so we skip this operation.
- `i = 1`: `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` are equal, we multiply `nums[1]` by 2 and change `nums[2]` to 0. The array becomes `[1,4,0,1,1,0]`.
- `i = 2`: `nums[2]` and `nums[3]` are not equal, so we skip this operation.
- `i = 3`: `nums[3]` and `nums[4]` are equal, we multiply `nums[3]` by 2 and change `nums[4]` to 0. The array becomes `[1,4,0,2,0,0]`.
- `i = 4`: `nums[4]` and `nums[5]` are equal, we multiply `nums[4]` by 2 and change `nums[5]` to 0. The array becomes `[1,4,0,2,0,0]`.

After that, we shift the 0's to the end, which gives the array `[1,4,2,0,0,0]`.

## Example 2:

```plaintext
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: [1,0]
```

**Explanation:**  
No operation can be applied, we just shift the 0 to the end.

## Constraints:

- `2 <= nums.length <= 2000`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

## Code(My Nala Code)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to move all zeroes to the end while maintaining the order of non-zero elements
    void moveZeroes(vector<int>& nums) {
        int i = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < nums.size(); j++) {
            if (nums[j] != 0) {
                swap(nums[j], nums[i]);
                i++;
            }
        }
    }

    // Function to double the elements if they are the same and set the next element to zero
    vector<int> applyOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; i++) {  // Ensure i+1 is within bounds
            if (nums[i] == nums[i + 1]) {
                nums[i] = 2 * nums[i];
                nums[i + 1] = 0;
            }
        }
        return nums;
    }
};
```
## Corrected version:)
The primary issue with my code is that the two functions `moveZeroes` and `applyOperations` are not called in sequence. In the LeetCode problem, I need to apply both operations in a specific order:

1. First, apply the `applyOperations` function to double elements and set the next element to zero.
2. Then, call the `moveZeroes` function to move all zeros to the end of the array.

To make it work as intended, I need a single function that combines both operations in the correct sequence. Here is the corrected implementation:

### Combined and Corrected Code

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> applyOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Step 1: Apply the specified operations to double elements and set the next element to zero
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] == nums[i + 1]) {
                nums[i] = 2 * nums[i];
                nums[i + 1] = 0;
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Move all zeros to the end while maintaining the order of non-zero elements
        int i = 0;  // Pointer for the position of the next non-zero element
        for (int j = 0; j < nums.size(); ++j) {
            if (nums[j] != 0) {
                swap(nums[j], nums[i]);
                i++;
            }
        }

        return nums;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of Combined Code

1. **Step 1: Apply the specified operations**:
    ```cpp
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; ++i) {
        if (nums[i] == nums[i + 1]) {
            nums[i] = 2 * nums[i];
            nums[i + 1] = 0;
        }
    }
    ```

    - Loop through the array until the second-to-last element.
    - If two consecutive elements are equal, double the value of the first element and set the second element to zero.

2. **Step 2: Move all zeros to the end while maintaining the order of non-zero elements**:
    ```cpp
    int i = 0;  // Pointer for the position of the next non-zero element
    for (int j = 0; j < nums.size(); ++j) {
        if (nums[j] != 0) {
            swap(nums[j], nums[i]);
            i++;
        }
    }
    ```

    - Initialize a pointer `i` to keep track of the position of the next non-zero element.
    - Loop through the array with pointer `j`.
    - If the current element is not zero, swap it with the element at position `i` and increment `i`.

3. **Return the modified array**:
    ```cpp
    return nums;
    ```
### Summary
This implementation first applies the operations to double the value of consecutive equal elements and set the second one to zero. Then, it moves all zeros to the end of the array while maintaining the order of the non-zero elements. This combined approach ensures that the solution meets the problem's requirements. By integrating both steps into a single function, we ensure that the operations are applied in the correct sequence, making the solution work as intended.

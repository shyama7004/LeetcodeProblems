# 186. Reverse Words in a String II

## Problem Statement

Given a character array `s`, reverse the order of the **words**.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in `s` will be separated by a single space.

Your code must solve the problem **in-place**, i.e., without allocating extra space.

## Example 1:

```text
Input: s = ["t","h","e"," ","s","k","y"," ","i","s"," ","b","l","u","e"]
Output: ["b","l","u","e"," ","i","s"," ","s","k","y"," ","t","h","e"]
```

## Example 2:

```text
Input: s = ["a"]
Output: ["a"]
```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s[i]` is an English letter (uppercase or lowercase), digit, or space `' '`.
- There is at least one word in `s`.
- `s` does not contain leading or trailing spaces.
- All the words in `s` are guaranteed to be separated by a single space.

## Code


1. Reverse the entire string.
2. Reverse each word within the string.
3. No extra space is used apart from a few variables.

### Optimized Approach

1. **Reverse the entire string** to get the words in the correct order but reversed.
2. **Reverse each word** to restore the correct order within the words.

### Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Function to reverse a part of the vector
void reverseRange(vector<char>& s, int start, int end) {
    while (start < end) {
        swap(s[start], s[end]);
        start++;
        end--;
    }
}

// Function to reverse words in the given string
void reverseWords(vector<char>& s) {
    int n = s.size();
    // Step 1: Reverse the entire string
    reverseRange(s, 0, n - 1);

    // Step 2: Reverse each word
    int wordStart = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (s[i] != ' ' && wordStart == -1) {
            wordStart = i;
        } else if (s[i] == ' ' && wordStart != -1) {
            reverseRange(s, wordStart, i - 1);
            wordStart = -1;
        }
    }
    // Handle the last word
    if (wordStart != -1) {
        reverseRange(s, wordStart, n - 1);
    }
}

// Helper function to print the vector
void printVector(const vector<char>& s) {
    for (char c : s) {
        cout << c;
    }
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    vector<char> s = {'t', 'h', 'e', ' ', 's', 'k', 'y', ' ', 'i', 's', ' ', 'b', 'l', 'u', 'e'};

    cout << "Original: ";
    printVector(s);

    reverseWords(s);

    cout << "Reversed: ";
    printVector(s);

    return 0;
}
```

### Code Context

This segment is responsible for reversing each word in the reversed string:
```cpp
// Step 2: Reverse each word
int wordStart = -1;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (s[i] != ' ' && wordStart == -1) {
        wordStart = i;
    } else if (s[i] == ' ' && wordStart != -1) {
        reverseRange(s, wordStart, i - 1);
        wordStart = -1;
    }
}
// Handle the last word
if (wordStart != -1) {
    reverseRange(s, wordStart, n - 1);
}
```

### Cases Explained

1. **Identifying the Start of a Word:**
   ```cpp
   if (s[i] != ' ' && wordStart == -1) {
       wordStart = i;
   }
   ```
   **Condition:** `s[i] != ' ' && wordStart == -1`
   - **s[i] != ' ':** The current character is not a space, meaning it's part of a word.
   - **wordStart == -1:** Indicates that no word start has been recorded yet.

   **Action:** Set `wordStart` to the current index `i`.
   - This marks the beginning of a new word.
   - This case is triggered when the loop encounters the first character of a word.

2. **Identifying the End of a Word:**
   ```cpp
   else if (s[i] == ' ' && wordStart != -1) {
       reverseRange(s, wordStart, i - 1);
       wordStart = -1;
   }
   ```
   **Condition:** `s[i] == ' ' && wordStart != -1`
   - **s[i] == ' ':** The current character is a space, meaning the end of a word has been reached.
   - **wordStart != -1:** Indicates that the start of a word has been recorded.

   **Action:** Reverse the characters in the word from `wordStart` to `i - 1`.
   - The function `reverseRange` is called to reverse the identified word.
   - Reset `wordStart` to `-1` to indicate that no word start is currently recorded.

3. **Handling the Last Word:**
   ```cpp
   if (wordStart != -1) {
       reverseRange(s, wordStart, n - 1);
   }
   ```
   **Condition:** `wordStart != -1`
   - **wordStart != -1:** Indicates that the start of a word has been recorded, and we have reached the end of the vector without encountering a space.

   **Action:** Reverse the characters in the word from `wordStart` to the end of the vector (`n - 1`).
   - This handles the case where the last word in the vector is not followed by a space.

### Example Walkthrough

Consider the input vector: `{'t', 'h', 'e', ' ', 's', 'k', 'y', ' ', 'i', 's', ' ', 'b', 'l', 'u', 'e'}`

After reversing the entire string, it becomes: `{'e', 'u', 'l', 'b', ' ', 's', 'i', ' ', 'y', 'k', 's', ' ', 'e', 'h', 't'}`

- **First Iteration:**
  - `i = 0`: `s[0]` is `'e'`, not a space, and `wordStart` is `-1`.
  - Set `wordStart = 0`.

- **Subsequent Iterations:**
  - `i = 1, 2, 3`: Characters are part of the word.
  - `i = 4`: `s[4]` is a space, and `wordStart` is `0`.
  - Reverse the word from `wordStart (0)` to `i - 1 (3)`: `{'b', 'l', 'u', 'e', ' ', 's', 'i', ' ', 'y', 'k', 's', ' ', 'e', 'h', 't'}`.
  - Reset `wordStart = -1`.

- **Continue Iterations:**
  - `i = 5`: `s[5]` is `'s'`, not a space, and `wordStart` is `-1`.
  - Set `wordStart = 5`.
  - `i = 6`: Character is part of the word.
  - `i = 7`: `s[7]` is a space, and `wordStart` is `5`.
  - Reverse the word from `wordStart (5)` to `i - 1 (6)`: `{'b', 'l', 'u', 'e', ' ', 'i', 's', ' ', 'y', 'k', 's', ' ', 'e', 'h', 't'}`.
  - Reset `wordStart = -1`.

- **Continue Iterations:**
  - `i = 8`: `s[8]` is `'y'`, not a space, and `wordStart` is `-1`.
  - Set `wordStart = 8`.
  - `i = 9, 10`: Characters are part of the word.
  - `i = 11`: `s[11]` is a space, and `wordStart` is `8`.
  - Reverse the word from `wordStart (8)` to `i - 1 (10)`: `{'b', 'l', 'u', 'e', ' ', 'i', 's', ' ', 's', 'k', 'y', ' ', 'e', 'h', 't'}`.
  - Reset `wordStart = -1`.

- **Final Iteration:**
  - `i = 12`: `s[12]` is `'e'`, not a space, and `wordStart` is `-1`.
  - Set `wordStart = 12`.
  - `i = 13, 14`: Characters are part of the word.

- **End of Vector:**
  - After the loop, `wordStart` is `12`.
  - Reverse the word from `wordStart (12)` to the end (`n - 1`): `{'b', 'l', 'u', 'e', ' ', 'i', 's', ' ', 's', 'k', 'y', ' ', 't', 'h', 'e'}`.

By handling these three cases, the function effectively reverses each word within the reversed string, resulting in the correct order of words with each word itself correctly oriented.

### Explanation

1. **Reverse the Entire String:**
   - The entire string is reversed, so the words are in the reverse order but each word itself is reversed.
   - Example: "the sky is blue" becomes "eulb si yks eht".

2. **Reverse Each Word:**
   - Iterate through the reversed string and reverse each word back to its correct form.
   - Find the start and end of each word by looking for spaces.
   - Reverse each word in place.

3. **Print the Result:**
   - The reversed words are printed, resulting in "blue is sky the".

### Output

The program will output:

```
Original: the sky is blue
Reversed: blue is sky the
```

This implementation is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of characters in the string, and it uses O(1) extra space apart from the input.

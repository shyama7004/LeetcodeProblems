# 283. Move Zeroes

**Companies:** Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Yandex

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

---

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:** `nums = [0,1,0,3,12]`

**Output:** `[1,3,12,0,0]`

### Example 2:

**Input:** `nums = [0]`

**Output:** `[0]`

---

## Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`

---

## Follow Up:

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void moveZeroes(vector<int>& nums) {
        int i = 0 ;
        for(int j = 0;j<nums.size();j++)
        {
            if(nums[j] != 0)
            {
                swap(nums[j],nums[i]);
                i++;
            }

        }
    }
};
```
## Two pointer's approach
1. **Initialize a Pointer `i`**: 
   - Start with `i = 0`, which will track the position to place the next non-zero element.

2. **Iterate Over the Array**:
   - Use a loop with `j` to go through each element in the array.

3. **Check for Non-Zero Elements**:
   - If the current element (`nums[j]`) is not zero, swap it with the element at position `i`.

4. **Swap and Increment**:
   - Swap `nums[j]` with `nums[i]` to move the non-zero element to the correct position.
   - Increment `i` to move to the next position for placing a non-zero element.

By the end of the loop, all non-zero elements are moved to the beginning of the array in their original order, and all zeroes are moved to the end.

### Example

For `nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]`:

- After processing, `nums` becomes `[1, 3, 12, 0, 0]`.

# 1752. Check if Array Is Sorted and Rotated

Given an array `nums`, return `true` if the array was originally sorted in non-decreasing order, then rotated some number of positions (including zero). Otherwise, return `false`.

There may be duplicates in the original array.

**Note:** An array `A` rotated by `x` positions results in an array `B` of the same length such that `A[i] == B[(i+x) % A.length]`, where `%` is the modulo operation.

## Example 1:

- **Input:** `nums = [3,4,5,1,2]`
- **Output:** `true`
- **Explanation:** `[1,2,3,4,5]` is the original sorted array.  
  You can rotate the array by `x = 3` positions to begin on the element of value `3`: `[3,4,5,1,2]`.

## Example 2:

- **Input:** `nums = [2,1,3,4]`
- **Output:** `false`
- **Explanation:** There is no sorted array once rotated that can make `nums`.

## Example 3:

- **Input:** `nums = [1,2,3]`
- **Output:** `true`
- **Explanation:** `[1,2,3]` is the original sorted array.  
  You can rotate the array by `x = 0` positions (i.e. no rotation) to make `nums`.

## Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool check(vector<int>& nums) {
        int count = 0;
        int n = nums.size();

        for(int i = 1;i < n;i++)
        {
            if(nums[i - 1] > nums[i])
            {
                count++;
            }

        }
        if(nums[n - 1] > nums[0])
        {
            count++;
        }
        return count <= 1;
    }
};
```

### Logic and Intuition

The provided code checks whether a given array `nums` is sorted and rotated. A sorted and rotated array is an array that was originally sorted in ascending order, but then some leading elements were moved to the end of the array while maintaining the order.

#### Key Points:
1. **Count Inversions:** An inversion is a situation where a previous element is greater than the next element in the array. For a sorted and rotated array, there can be at most one inversion in the array.
2. **Special Case Check:** Check if the last element is greater than the first element. If true, it indicates that the array has been rotated across the boundary.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Initialize Count:**
   ```cpp
   int count = 0;
   int n = nums.size();
   ```
   - `count` will keep track of the number of inversions found.
   - `n` stores the size of the array.

2. **Loop through the Array:**
   ```cpp
   for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
       if (nums[i - 1] > nums[i]) {
           count++;
       }
   }
   ```
   - This loop starts from the second element (`i = 1`) and goes to the last element (`i < n`).

### Why Start from `i = 1`?

- **Checking Pairs**: The loop compares each element with its previous element. The comparison `nums[i - 1] > nums[i]` only makes sense when `i` is at least 1. Starting from `i = 1` allows the code to access `nums[i - 1]` without going out of bounds.
- **Boundary Condition**: The code needs to check pairs of consecutive elements to find where the sorted order breaks. This is naturally done by starting from the second element (i.e., `i = 1`) and going to the last element.

   - For each element, it checks if the previous element (`nums[i - 1]`) is greater than the current element (`nums[i]`).
   - If it is, it means there is an inversion, so increment the `count`.

3. **Check the Boundary Condition:**
   ```cpp
   if (nums[n - 1] > nums[0]) {
       count++;
   }
   ```
   - After the loop, it checks if the last element (`nums[n - 1]`) is greater than the first element (`nums[0]`).
   - This check is necessary because the array could be rotated such that the largest element moves to the beginning. For example, `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`.

4. **Return the Result:**
   ```cpp
   return count <= 1;
   ```
   - The array is considered sorted and rotated if there is at most one inversion, so `count` should be less than or equal to 1.
   - If `count` is 0 or 1, it means the array is either already sorted or sorted and rotated. Otherwise, it is not.

### Example Walkthrough

Consider `nums = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`:
- **Step 1:** Initialize `count = 0` and `n = 5`.
- **Step 2:** Loop through the array:
  - `i = 1`: `nums[0] = 3`, `nums[1] = 4` (No inversion)
  - `i = 2`: `nums[1] = 4`, `nums[2] = 5` (No inversion)
  - `i = 3`: `nums[2] = 5`, `nums[3] = 1` (Inversion, increment `count` to 1)
  - `i = 4`: `nums[3] = 1`, `nums[4] = 2` (No inversion)
- **Step 3:** Check boundary condition:
  - `nums[4] = 2`, `nums[0] = 3` (No inversion at boundary)
- **Step 4:** `count = 1`, which is less than or equal to 1, so return `true`.

The array `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]` is sorted and rotated, so the function correctly returns `true`.

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N) because we iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) because we use a constant amount of extra space.

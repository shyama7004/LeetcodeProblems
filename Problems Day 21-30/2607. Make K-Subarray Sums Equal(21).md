# 2607. Make K-Subarray Sums Equal

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `arr` and an integer `k`. The array `arr` is circular. In other words, the first element of the array is the next element of the last element, and the last element of the array is the previous element of the first element.

You can do the following operation any number of times:

Pick any element from `arr` and increase or decrease it by `1`.

Return the minimum number of operations such that the sum of each subarray of length `k` is equal.

A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.

## Example 1:

- **Input:** `arr = [1,4,1,3], k = 2`
- **Output:** `1`
- **Explanation:** We can do one operation on index 1 to make its value equal to 3.  
  The array after the operation is `[1,3,1,3]`.
  - Subarray starting at index 0 is `[1, 3]`, and its sum is `4`.
  - Subarray starting at index 1 is `[3, 1]`, and its sum is `4`.
  - Subarray starting at index 2 is `[1, 3]`, and its sum is `4`.
  - Subarray starting at index 3 is `[3, 1]`, and its sum is `4`.

## Example 2:

- **Input:** `arr = [2,5,5,7], k = 3`
- **Output:** `5`
- **Explanation:** We can do three operations on index 0 to make its value equal to 5 and two operations on index 3 to make its value equal to 5.  
  The array after the operations is `[5,5,5,5]`.
  - Subarray starting at index 0 is `[5, 5, 5]`, and its sum is `15`.
  - Subarray starting at index 1 is `[5, 5, 5]`, and its sum is `15`.
  - Subarray starting at index 2 is `[5, 5, 5]`, and its sum is `15`.
  - Subarray starting at index 3 is `[5, 5, 5]`, and its sum is `15`.

## Constraints:

- `1 <= k <= arr.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`


### Problem Explanation:
The problem is to make the sum of each subarray of length `k` in a circular array equal with the minimum number of operations. Each operation involves increasing or decreasing any element of the array by 1.

### Approach
The approach to solve this problem involves the following steps:
1. **Identify Cycles in the Circular Array:** By moving `k` steps from any index `i`, we form a cycle.
2. **Make Elements in Each Cycle Equal:** For each cycle, we make all elements equal to minimize the total cost. This is typically achieved by setting all elements to the median value of the cycle.

### Detailed Breakdown of the Code

#### `find` Function
This function calculates the total cost to make all elements in an array equal to a specified value.

##### Code Explanation
```cpp
long long find(int val, vector<int>& arr) {
    long long ans = 0; // Initialize the total cost to 0
    
    // Iterate through each element in the array
    for (auto& x : arr) {
        long long cur = abs(x - val); // Calculate the absolute difference between the current element and val
        ans += cur; // Add the absolute difference to the total cost
    }
    
    return ans; // Return the total cost
}
```

<summary>Absolute difference Explanation</summary>

### Absolute Difference

The **absolute difference** between two numbers is a way of measuring how far apart they are, without worrying about which one is larger. It always gives a non-negative result.

### Formula
For two numbers `a` and `b`, the absolute difference is calculated as:
```
Absolute Difference = |a - b|
```
Here, the `| |` symbols represent the absolute value, which just means that you ignore any negative sign.

### Examples

1. **Positive Numbers:**
   - If `a = 7` and `b = 3`, the absolute difference is:
     ```
     |7 - 3| = 4
     ```
   - This means the numbers 7 and 3 are 4 units apart.

2. **One Positive and One Negative Number:**
   - If `a = -5` and `b = 2`, the absolute difference is:
     ```
     |-5 - 2| = 7
     ```
   - This shows that -5 and 2 are 7 units apart.

3. **Both Negative Numbers:**
   - If `a = -4` and `b = -8`, the absolute difference is:
     ```
     |-4 - (-8)| = 4
     ```
   - The numbers -4 and -8 are 4 units apart.

### Usage in the Provided Code
In the code, the absolute difference is used to calculate the cost of converting one element in the array to a target value:

```cpp
long long cur = abs(x - val);
```
- `x` is the current element in the array.
- `val` is the target value you want all elements to become.

The absolute difference `abs(x - val)` tells us how many steps (increases or decreases) are needed to change `x` to `val`.

For example, if `x = 7` and `val = 5`, the absolute difference `abs(7 - 5)` equals 2. This means 2 operations are needed to change 7 into 5.

#### `makeSubKSumEqual` Function
This function calculates the minimum number of operations to make the sum of every subarray of length `k` in the circular array equal.

##### Code Explanation
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long makeSubKSumEqual(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        int n = arr.size(); // Get the size of the array
        long long ans = 0; // Initialize the total answer to 0
        vector<int> vis(n, 0); // Create a visited array to track visited elements

        // Iterate over each element in the array
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (vis[i]) continue; // Skip already visited elements

            vector<int> temp; // Temporary array to store elements of the current cycle
            int idx = i; // Start index of the cycle

            // Traverse the cycle
            while (!vis[idx]) {
                vis[idx] = 1; // Mark the current index as visited
                temp.push_back(arr[idx]); // Add the value to the temp array
                idx = (idx + k) % n; // Move to the next index in the cycle, wrapping around using modulo
            }

            // Sort the elements in the cycle
            sort(temp.begin(), temp.end());
            int sz = temp.size(); // Size of the cycle
            long long cur = 0; // Current cycle cost

            // If the cycle has an odd number of elements
            if (sz % 2) {
                int mid = sz / 2; // Middle element index
                cur = find(temp[mid], temp); // Calculate the cost to make all elements equal to the middle element
            } else {
                // If the cycle has an even number of elements
                int mid = sz / 2; // First middle element index
                cur = find(temp[mid], temp); // Cost for the first middle element
                cur = min(cur, find(temp[mid - 1], temp)); // Minimum cost between the two middle elements
            }

            ans += cur; // Add the cycle cost to the total answer
        }

        return ans; // Return the total minimum cost
    }
};
```

<summary>What is a Equivalent Modulo ?</summary>

  The term "equivalent modulo" refers to the relationship between two numbers when they have the same remainder when divided by a particular number, often called the modulus.

### What Does "Equivalent Modulo `k`" Mean?

When we say that two indices \(i\) and \(j\) are "equivalent modulo `k`", we mean:

[i % k = j % k]

Where:
- `i % k` is the remainder when `i` is divided by `k`.
- `j % k` is the remainder when `j` is divided by `k`.

If the remainders are the same, then `i` and `j` are said to be equivalent modulo `k`.

### Why is This Important in the Problem?

In the context of this problem:
- The array is circular, and you are concerned with subarrays of length `k`.
- When you consider subarrays of length `k`, the elements that share the same index modulo `k` will always appear in the same relative positions in those subarrays.

**Example**:
Let's say we have an array `arr = [a, b, c, d, e, f]` and `k = 3`.

- Index `0 % 3 = 0`
- Index `1 % 3 = 1`
- Index `2 % 3 = 2`
- Index `3 % 3 = 0`
- Index `4 % 3 = 1`
- Index `5 % 3 = 2`

Here:
- Elements `a` and `d` (at indices `0` and `3`) are equivalent modulo `3`, because both have a remainder of `0` when divided by `3`.
- Elements `b` and `e` (at indices `1` and `4`) are equivalent modulo `3`, because both have a remainder of `1`.
- Elements `c` and `f` (at indices `2` and `5`) are equivalent modulo `3`, because both have a remainder of `2`.

### Relevance to the Problem:

When you group elements by their index modulo `k`, you are effectively grouping elements that will always occupy the same positions in different subarrays of length `k`. By making the sums of these groups equal (or their elements equal), you ensure that all subarrays of length `k` have the same sum, which is the goal of the problem.

### Crucial code explanation

```cpp
            while (!vis[idx]) {
                vis[idx] = 1; // Mark the current index as visited
                temp.push_back(arr[idx]); // Add the value to the temp array
                idx = (idx + k) % n; // Move to the next index in the cycle, wrapping around using modulo
            }
```
- `!vis[idx]` evaluates to `true` if `vis[idx]` is `0` (meaning the element at index `idx` has not been visited).
- The `while` loop continues as long as `!vis[idx]` is `true`, which means it keeps traversing the cycle until it encounters an index that has already been visited.
- **Store Value**: Add the value `arr[idx]` to `temp`.
- **Next Index**: Update `idx` to `(idx + k) % n`, which moves to the next index in the cycle, wrapping around using modulo `n`.

### Sorting and Cost Calculation
```cpp
            sort(temp.begin(), temp.end());
            int sz = temp.size(); // Size of the cycle
            long long cur = 0; // Current cycle cost
```


- **Sort the Cycle**: Sort the elements in `temp`.
- **Cycle Size**: `sz` is set to the size of the cycle.
- **Current Cycle Cost**: `cur` is initialized to 0 to store the cost for the current cycle.
  
The sorting of the `temp` array in the given code is done to facilitate finding the minimum cost to make all elements in the cycle equal. Here's why:

### Purpose of Sorting:
1. **Aligning Elements for Cost Calculation:**
   - The `temp` array contains elements from the current cycle of the original array `arr`.
   - Sorting the `temp` array orders the elements in ascending order.
   - By sorting, you can easily determine the median element(s) of the cycle.

2. **Minimizing the Cost:**
   - The goal is to make all elements in the cycle equal by choosing a target value (usually the median) that minimizes the sum of absolute differences.
   - **Median Minimizes Sum of Absolute Differences:** 
     - For an odd-sized cycle, the median of the sorted `temp` array minimizes the total cost of making all elements in the cycle equal.
     - For an even-sized cycle, either of the two middle elements in the sorted `temp` array can serve as the target. The code compares the costs for both possible middle elements and picks the minimum.


### Median Calculation and Cost Minimization
```cpp
            if (sz % 2) {
                int mid = sz / 2; // Middle element index
                cur = find(temp[mid], temp); // Calculate the cost to make all elements equal to the middle element
```
- **Odd-Sized Cycle**: If the cycle size `sz` is odd:
  - **Median Index**: `mid` is set to the middle index.
  - **Cost Calculation**: Use the `find` function to calculate the cost to make all elements equal to the median element `temp[mid]`.

```cpp
            } else {
                int mid = sz / 2; // First middle element index
                cur = find(temp[mid], temp); // Cost for the first middle element
                cur = min(cur, find(temp[mid - 1], temp)); // Minimum cost between the two middle elements
            }
```
- **Even-Sized Cycle**: If the cycle size `sz` is even:
  - **Median Index**: `mid` is set to the first middle index.
  - **Cost Calculation**: Compute the cost to make all elements equal to `temp[mid]`.
  - **Minimize Cost**: Compute the cost for the other middle element `temp[mid - 1]` and take the minimum of the two costs.

### Accumulate Total Cost
```cpp
            ans += cur; // Add the cycle cost to the total answer
        }
```
- **Update Total Cost**: Add the cost for the current cycle `cur` to the total cost `ans`.

### Return Result
```cpp
        return ans; // Return the total minimum cost
    }
};
```
- **Return**: Return the total minimum cost `ans`.

### Notes on `find` Function

The `find` function is expected to calculate the cost to equalize elements to a specified value. The definition of this function is missing in the provided code, but based on its usage, it should take a target value and a vector of elements to compute the total cost.

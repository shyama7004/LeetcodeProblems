# 2124. Check if All A's Appear Before All B's

**Companies:** Microsoft

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` consisting of only the characters `'a'` and `'b'`, return `true` if every `'a'` appears before every `'b'` in the string. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `s = "aaabbb"`  
**Output:** `true`  
**Explanation:**  
The `'a'`s are at indices 0, 1, and 2, while the `'b'`s are at indices 3, 4, and 5.  
Hence, every `'a'` appears before every `'b'` and we return `true`.

### Example 2

**Input:** `s = "abab"`  
**Output:** `false`  
**Explanation:**  
There is an `'a'` at index 2 and a `'b'` at index 1.  
Hence, not every `'a'` appears before every `'b'` and we return `false`.

### Example 3

**Input:** `s = "bbb"`  
**Output:** `true`  
**Explanation:**  
There are no `'a'`s, hence, every `'a'` appears before every `'b'` and we return `true`.

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s[i]` is either `'a'` or `'b'`.

## My nala code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkString(string s) {
        for(int i = 0; i < s.size() - 1; i++)
        char b;
        char a;
        {
            if(s[i] == b && s[i+1] == a)
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

## Thought Process
I initially considered applying a concept similar to how elements are checked in an array. The idea was to iterate through the string, comparing adjacent elements to ensure a certain order is maintained. In this case, I wanted to ensure that all occurrences of the character `'b'` come before any occurrences of the character `'a'`.

## Logic
The primary logic is straightforward: as I iterate through the string, if I encounter a `'b'` followed by an `'a'`, it violates the required order, so I return `false`. If no such violation is found after checking the entire string, I return `true`. This approach ensures that the string maintains the desired order of characters.


There are a few issues in the code that need to be addressed. Here's a corrected version:

1. The variables `char a` and `char b` are not initialized properly.
2. The scope of these variables is not correct; they should be defined outside the loop.
3. The logic to check the conditions seems to be inverted (based on the common interpretation of what this function might be intended to do).

Here is a corrected version of your code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkString(string s) {
        for(int i = 0; i < s.size() - 1; i++) {
            if(s[i] == 'b' && s[i+1] == 'a') {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization of Characters:**
   - Instead of using variables `char a` and `char b`, I've replaced them with the characters `'a'` and `'b'` directly in the condition.

2. **Scope of Variables:**
   - The characters `'a'` and `'b'` are used directly in the condition check, so there's no need to declare separate variables.

3. **Logic Correction:**
   - The loop checks each character in the string `s` and returns `false` if it finds a `'b'` followed by an `'a'`. If no such pair is found, the function returns `true`.

This code will now correctly check if all `'b'` characters appear before any `'a'` in the string.

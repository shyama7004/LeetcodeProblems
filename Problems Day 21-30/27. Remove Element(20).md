# 27. Remove Element

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, Adobe, Google, Microsoft  

## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val`.

Consider the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val` be `k`. To get accepted, you need to do the following:

1. Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the elements which are not equal to `val`. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
2. Return `k`.

## In-place Algorithm

### Introduction
- **In computer science, an in-place algorithm** is an algorithm that operates directly on the input data structure without requiring extra space proportional to the input size. 
- **Key Feature**: Modifies the input in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure.
- **Terminology**: An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.

### Definitions and Variations
- **Strict Definition**: The algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, including everything such as function calls and pointers.
  - **Limitation**: Even having an index to a length n array requires O(log n) bits.
- **Broader Definition**: The algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space.
  - **Typical Space**: Usually O(log n) space, though sometimes anything in o(n) is allowed.

### Space Complexity Considerations
- **Total Space Complexity (DSPACE)**: Counts pointer lengths, which means there is an extra O(log n) factor compared to an analysis that ignores the length of indices and pointers.
- **Output Space**: An algorithm may or may not count the output as part of its space usage. In-place algorithms usually overwrite their input with output, so no additional space is needed.

### Examples

#### Reversing an Array
- **Out-of-Place Method**: Requires \(O(n)\) extra space.
  ```cpp
  function reverse(a[0..n-1])
      allocate b[0..n-1]
      for i from 0 to n-1
          b[n-1-i] := a[i]
      return b
  ```
- **In-Place Method**: Uses constant space (2 integers).
  ```cpp
  function reverse_in_place(a[0..n-1])
      for i from 0 to floor((n-2)/2)
          tmp := a[i]
          a[i] := a[n-1-i]
          a[n-1-i] := tmp
  ```

#### Sorting Algorithms
- Many sorting algorithms rearrange arrays into sorted order in-place, including:
  - Bubble sort
  - Comb sort
  - Selection sort
  - Insertion sort
  - Heapsort
  - Shell sort
  - Quicksort (requires O(log n) stack space)
- **Space Complexity**: Usually O(log n) due to pointers.

### Computational Complexity

#### Strict Definition
- **Class DSPACE(1)**: Algorithms with \(O(1)\) space complexity.
  - **Limitation**: This class is very limited; it equals the regular languages.

#### Practical Definition
- **Class L**: Problems requiring \(O(\log n)\) additional space.
  - **Examples**: There is an in-place algorithm to determine whether a path exists between two nodes in an undirected graph, which typically requires \(O(n)\) extra space using algorithms like depth-first search.

### Role of Randomness
- **Randomized Algorithms**: Can drastically cut space requirements.
  - **Example**: Random walk in a graph to determine if two vertices are in the same connected component.
  - **Other Examples**: Millerâ€“Rabin primality test, Pollard's rho algorithm for factoring.

### Functional Programming
- **Functional Languages**: Often discourage or do not support explicit in-place algorithms that overwrite data.
  - **Optimization**: Good functional language compilers optimize similar objects and old ones are thrown away, effectively mutating under the hood.
- **Possible Construction**: In principle, it is possible to construct in-place algorithms that do not modify data, but this is rarely done in practice.

3. **RL (complexity)**: Class of problems that involve randomness to reduce space complexity.

### Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

```cpp
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int val = ...; // Value to remove
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
// It is sorted with no values equaling val.

int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

## Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
```

**Explanation:**  
Your function should return `k = 2`, with the first two elements of `nums` being `2`.  
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned `k` (hence they are underscores).

## Example 2:

```plaintext
Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
```

**Explanation:**  
Your function should return `k = 5`, with the first five elements of `nums` containing `0`, `1`, `4`, `0`, and `3`.  
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.  
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned `k` (hence they are underscores).

---

## Constraints:

- `0 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 50`
- `0 <= val <= 100`

## Code(My not so nala code)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int removeElement(vector<int>& nums, int val) {
        int count = nums.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size();) {  // No increment in the loop declaration
            if (nums[i] == val) {
                nums.erase(nums.begin() + i);  // Corrected the erase to use an iterator
                count--;
            } else {
                i++;  // Increment only if we don't erase
            }
        }
        return count;  // Fixed the typo in return statement
    }
};

```

## More efficient two-pointers approach

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int removeElement(vector<int>& nums, int val) {
        int count = 0; // Counter for elements not equal to val
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] != val) {
                nums[count] = nums[i];
                count++;
            }
        }
        // Resize the vector to only include elements not equal to val
        nums.resize(count);
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
1. **Counter `count`**: We use a counter to keep track of the number of elements not equal to `val`.
2. **Loop to Check Elements**: We iterate through the vector. If the current element is not equal to `val`, we place it at the position indicated by `count` and increment `count`.
3. **Resize the Vector**: After the loop, we resize the vector to `count`, removing any trailing elements that were originally equal to `val`.
4. **Return the Count**: Finally, return the count of elements not equal to `val`.

### Example Usage:
To see how this works, you can use the following main function:

```cpp
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> nums = {3, 2, 2, 3};
    int val = 3;
    int remaining = sol.removeElement(nums, val);
    cout << "Number of elements remaining: " << remaining << endl;
    cout << "Modified array: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < remaining; i++) {
        cout << nums[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Output:
```
Number of elements remaining: 2
Modified array: 2 2 
```

This ensures the vector is modified in-place and returns the count of elements not equal to `val`.

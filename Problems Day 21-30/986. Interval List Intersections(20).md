# 986. Interval List Intersections

You are given two lists of closed intervals, `firstList` and `secondList`, where `firstList[i] = [starti, endi]` and `secondList[j] = [startj, endj]`. Each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

A **closed interval** `[a, b]` (with `a <= b`) denotes the set of real numbers `x` with `a <= x <= b`.

The **intersection** of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a closed interval. For example, the intersection of `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]` is `[2, 3]`.

## Example 1:
<div align ="center"><img src = "https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/30/interval1.png"></div>

```plaintext
Input: firstList = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], 
       secondList = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]
```

## Example 2:

```plaintext
Input: firstList = [[1,3],[5,9]], 
       secondList = []
Output: []
```

## Constraints:

- `0 <= firstList.length, secondList.length <= 1000`
- `firstList.length + secondList.length >= 1`
- `0 <= starti < endi <= 10^9`
- `0 <= startj < endj <= 10^9`
## Code

### Logic and Approach

The goal is to find the intersection of intervals between two lists of intervals, `firstList` and `secondList`. An interval is represented as a pair of integers `[start, end]`.

### Intuition

1. **Two-Pointer Technique**: 
    - Use two pointers `i` and `j` to iterate through `firstList` and `secondList` respectively.
    - Compare intervals from both lists to find intersections.

2. **Intersection Check**:
    - An intersection occurs if the intervals overlap. 
    - Overlapping means the start of one interval is less than or equal to the end of the other interval and vice versa.

3. **Advancing Pointers**:
    - Move the pointer of the interval that ends first. This helps in checking the next potential intersection in an efficient manner.

### Code Explanation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> intervalIntersection(vector<vector<int>>& firstList, vector<vector<int>>& secondList) {
        // Initialize the result vector to store the intersections
        vector<vector<int>> ans;

        // Initialize two pointers to iterate over both lists
        int i = 0, j = 0;

        // Loop until we reach the end of either list
        while (i < firstList.size() && j < secondList.size()) {
            // Calculate the start and end of the potential intersection
            int start = max(firstList[i][0], secondList[j][0]);
            int end = min(firstList[i][1], secondList[j][1]);

            // Check if the calculated start and end form a valid intersection
            if (start <= end) {
                // If valid, add the intersection to the result vector
                ans.push_back({start, end});
            }

            // Determine which interval to move forward
            // Move the pointer of the interval which ends first
            if (firstList[i][1] < secondList[j][1]) {
                i++;
            } else {
                j++;
            }
        }

        // Return the result vector containing all intersections
        return ans;
    }
};
```

### Detailed Line-by-Line Explanation


1. **`vector<vector<int>> ans;`**:
   - Initialize an empty vector `ans` to store the intersected intervals.

2. **`int i = 0, j = 0;`**:
   - Initialize two pointers `i` and `j` to iterate through `firstList` and `secondList` respectively.

3. **`while (i < firstList.size() && j < secondList.size()) {`**:
   - Loop through both lists until the end of either list is reached.

4. **`int start = max(firstList[i][0], secondList[j][0]);`**:
   - Calculate the start of the intersection as the maximum of the start times of the current intervals.

5. **`int end = min(firstList[i][1], secondList[j][1]);`**:
    - Calculate the end of the intersection as the minimum of the end times of the current intervals.

6. **`if (start <= end) {`**:
    - Check if the calculated start and end form a valid intersection (i.e., start is less than or equal to end).

7. **`ans.push_back({start, end});`**:
    - If valid, add the intersection `[start, end]` to the result vector `ans`.

8. **`if (firstList[i][1] < secondList[j][1]) {`**:
    - Check which interval ends first. If `firstList[i]` ends before `secondList[j]`, increment `i` to move to the next interval in `firstList`.

9. **`i++;`**:
    - Move the pointer `i` to the next interval in `firstList`.


10. **`j++;`**:
    - Move the pointer `j` to the next interval in `secondList`.
      
## Top Voted Solution
```cpp
vector<vector<int>> res;
for(int i = 0, j = 0; i < A.size() && j < B.size();) {
	int lo = max(A[i][0], B[j][0]), hi = min(A[i][1], B[j][1]);
	if(lo <= hi) res.push_back({lo, hi});
	if(hi == A[i][1]) i++;
	else j++;
}
return res;
```
### Snippet explanation

The line `if(hi == A[i][1])` checks if the end of the intersection (`hi`) is the same as the end of the current interval in list `A` (`A[i][1]`). If it is, it means the interval from `A` ends at `hi`, so the code moves to the next interval in `A` by incrementing `i`. If not, it moves to the next interval in `B` by incrementing `j`. This ensures that the algorithm efficiently progresses through both lists.
